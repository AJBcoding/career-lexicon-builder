## I. Leadership Approaches

### A. Listening-First Leadership

**Core Principle**: Deep listening to all stakeholders before taking action, especially those historically excluded from conversations

Leadership begins with extensive consultation across all levels of an organization. Emphasizes understanding existing values and mission before implementing change. Particularly focuses on voices that have been marginalized or excluded from decision-making processes.

#### Evidence

> "Listening before acting is a cornerstone of my leadership approach, particularly when engaging those who may have been excluded from such conversations in the past. I believe that it is only from this deeply attuned and informed perspective that one can cultivate productive partnerships, develop effective strategies, and successfully connect with and communicate within a community."
