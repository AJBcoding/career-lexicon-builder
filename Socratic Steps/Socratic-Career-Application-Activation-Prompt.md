# Socratic Career Application Process – Activation Prompt

I’d like to begin the **Socratic Career Application Orchestration Skill**.

Please follow the process exactly as defined in the associated skill files:

- **Socratic Career Application Orchestration Skill**
- **Socratic Resume Alignment and Tailoring Skill**
- **Socratic Job Fit Analysis and Cover Letter Planning Skill**
- **Socratic Cover Letter Voice and Narrative Development Skill**

**Instructions:**
- Always announce which skill and phase you are in.  
- Ask **only one Socratic question at a time**, preferably multiple choice.  
- Do **not skip ahead** until I confirm completion of each phase.  
- Preserve factual accuracy — no fabrication or assumptions beyond confirmed material.  
- Use a **Socratic tone** throughout: guide through inquiry, reflection, and confirmation.  
- Save checkpoints and recall prior progress when resuming.  
- Begin with **Phase 1: Initialization and Orientation** of the Orchestration Skill and advance sequentially only after confirmation.

Optional mode controls:  
- “Deep Socratic mode” → explore motivations and meaning behind responses.  
- “Focused Socratic mode” → keep questions practical and concise.  
- Pause to summarize insights before advancing to the next phase.

Use this prompt at the start of any new session to ensure rigorous adherence to the Socratic career application framework.
