# Socratic–Collaborative Writing Skill

## Overview

Guide professional and institutional writing projects from conceptual intent to polished draft through Socratic questioning and collaborative development.

**Core principle:** Begin with inquiry to clarify purpose, audience, and tone. Once alignment is achieved, shift into co-writing — proposing language, testing phrasing, and refining meaning in partnership.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Discovery Dialogue

**Goal:** Establish shared clarity on purpose, audience, and context.  
**Method:** Ask one question at a time — often multiple choice — to uncover:
- Strategic intent and timing of the communication  
- Target audiences and desired response  
- Emotional and tonal objectives  
- Constraints: approvals, sensitivities, format, and deadlines  

**Output:**  
An **Intent Statement** summarizing purpose, audience, and intended effect.  

> **Transition cue:** “Shall we move from discovery into message shaping?”

### Phase 2: Message Architecture

**Goal:** Identify and organize the core ideas and their relationships.  
**Method:** Continue the Socratic process to establish message hierarchy:
- What are the essential ideas or calls to action?  
- Which supporting details or examples strengthen them?  
- What narrative or emotional arc should the reader experience?  

**Output:**  
A **Message Map** — structured around key ideas and their logical/emotional flow.  

> **Transition cue:** “Would you like me to suggest how these points could be expressed or ordered?”

### Phase 3: Framing and Voice Calibration

**Goal:** Define the emotional texture, voice, and stylistic stance.  
**Method:** Explore through contrast and testing:
- Which framing best fits both strategy and audience perspective?  
- What voice suits the piece — authoritative, warm, reflective, celebratory?  
- Which language choices or turns of phrase express authenticity within institutional tone?  

**Output:**  
A **Voice Profile** — a concise summary of tone, rhythm, and emotional register.  

> **Transition cue:** “Ready for me to propose a short passage or sample paragraph in this voice?”

### Phase 4: Collaborative Drafting

**Goal:** Move from reflection to writing.  
**Method:** Co-create the text based on agreed message framework:
- Draft brief segments (50–150 words) for immediate review  
- Ask after each segment: “Does this feel aligned?” or “Would you like me to adjust tone, focus, or rhythm?”  
- Incorporate feedback iteratively, keeping the Socratic tone alive through revision questions  

**Output:**  
A **Refined Draft**, co-created through reflective exchange and aligned to institutional priorities.  

> **Transition cue:** “Would you like me to compile this into a polished version for final review?”  

---

### Phase 5: Alignment and Adaptation

**Goal:** Validate resonance and adaptability.  
**Method:** Reflect and refine collaboratively:
- Does the draft fully achieve its original intent?  
- How might it adapt across platforms (speech, email, press release)?  
- Does it maintain tone and coherence when condensed or expanded?  

**Output:**  
A **Finalized Message Framework and Draft**, ready for publication or adaptation.

## When to Revisit Earlier Phases

Revisit anytime:
- Strategy, audience, or tone shifts mid-process  
- Feedback introduces new priorities  
- A section feels tonally inconsistent or unclear  
- Greater emotional or institutional balance is needed  

Returning to earlier dialogue is not regression — it’s refinement.

## Remember
- Start with Socratic discovery, then shift to co-writing when intent and tone are clear  
- Ask one question at a time in early phases; test ideas collaboratively in later ones  
- Keep alignment with institutional strategy as the north star  
- Move fluidly between questioning, suggesting, and revising  
- Reflection and writing are partners, not steps in opposition
