# Socratic Job Fit Analysis and Cover Letter Planning Skill

## Overview

Guide the user through analyzing a job description after resume alignment, identifying gaps or stretch areas, and developing a Socratic plan for a compelling, authentic cover letter.

**Core principle:** Clarify the employer’s priorities, detect alignment strengths and weaknesses, and use Socratic questioning to explore truthful reframing and narrative strategy. All insights are grounded in verified resume material — no fabrication or exaggeration.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Reintroduction and Context Confirmation

**Goal:** Reorient to the job description and confirm alignment with the latest tailored resume framework.  
**Method:**  
- Summarize the job description’s main responsibilities, qualifications, and tone.  
- Reconstruct a concise summary of resume strengths from verified material.  
- Compare this summary to outputs from the Resume Alignment Skill.  
- Ask confirmation questions about differences, omissions, or updates.  

**Output:**  
A **Job–Resume Alignment Snapshot**, confirming a shared understanding before further analysis.

### Phase 2: Qualification Extraction and Clarification

**Goal:** Identify and confirm the job’s core qualifications, values, and expectations.  
**Method:**  
- Parse the job description for competencies, experience levels, and soft skills.  
- Present relevant excerpts to the user for clarification, e.g.:  
  > “This section emphasizes ‘strategic leadership in the arts.’ Would you interpret that as administrative, creative, or both?”  
- Group qualifications by theme and rank them by importance and emphasis.  

**Output:**  
A **Ranked Qualification Map** — organized by thematic groupings such as Leadership, Research, Communication, or Community Engagement.

---

### Phase 3: Gap and Stretch Analysis

**Goal:** Detect and confirm areas where the user’s background only partially meets job qualifications.  
**Method:**  
- Compare the Ranked Qualification Map with the user’s verified resume material.  
- Identify direct matches, partial matches, and missing experiences.  
- Present a grouped, ranked list of potential “stretch” areas, such as:  
  - **Leadership and Management (High Priority)**  
    - Strategic planning – partially demonstrated  
    - Budget oversight – not directly stated  
- For each stretch area, present the relevant job description text and ask:  
  > “Do you have related experience, perhaps in a role not listed, that could illustrate this skill?”  

**Output:**  
A **Liability and Stretch Matrix** — grouped by theme, ranked by priority, and validated by the user.

---

### Phase 4: Reframing Exploration

**Goal:** Transform stretch areas into positive narrative opportunities.  
**Method:**  
- For each confirmed stretch area, propose **2–3 reframing options**, for example:  
  - Highlight transferable skills (“While not a formal management role, I led interdisciplinary project teams.”)  
  - Reframe through growth (“This experience deepened my ability to adapt across disciplines.”)  
  - Emphasize potential (“This area represents a new challenge aligned with my long-term goals.”)  
- Seek user confirmation before adopting any phrasing or concept.  

**Output:**  
A **Reframing Strategy List**, pairing each gap with approved narrative positioning options.

### Phase 5: Socratic Cover Letter Planning

**Goal:** Develop a structured plan for the cover letter using confirmed strengths and reframed areas.  
**Method:**  
- Ask Socratic questions to guide organization and tone, e.g.:  
  - “Would you like to begin with your motivation or institutional alignment?”  
  - “Which reframed strengths should be emphasized directly versus indirectly?”  
- Build a four-part outline collaboratively:  
  1. Introduction and motivation  
  2. Alignment with mission and job purpose  
  3. Demonstrated competencies and reframed strengths  
  4. Closing reflection and enthusiasm  

**Output:**  
A **Cover Letter Framework Plan**, ready for drafting or collaborative development.

### Phase 6: Authenticity and Strategy Review

**Goal:** Ensure that the resume, reframing strategy, and cover letter plan form a coherent, truthful narrative.  
**Method:**  
- Review overall narrative and tone.  
- Ask reflective questions, e.g.:  
  > “Does this version feel authentic to your professional story?”  
  > “Are there reframings that overstate or understate your comfort zone?”  
- Revisit earlier phases if any section feels imbalanced or inauthentic.  

**Output:**  
A **Final Job Application Narrative Map**, uniting resume alignment, reframed positioning, and cover letter strategy.

## When to Revisit Earlier Phases

Revisit when:  
- A new job description version is provided.  
- Additional or unlisted experiences emerge.  
- The user adjusts career emphasis or tone preferences.  
- The narrative balance between authenticity and competitiveness needs refinement.
