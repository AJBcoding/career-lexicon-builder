# Socratic Career Application Orchestration Skill

## Overview

A comprehensive Socratic-guided framework for developing tailored, authentic, and strategically aligned job application materials — moving step by step from job description analysis to resume refinement, cover letter planning, and narrative development.

**Core principle:** Guide the user through a structured yet reflective process that integrates strategic alignment with authentic self-expression. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring factual accuracy, emotional coherence, and professional resonance.

This meta-skill orchestrates three core sub-skills:
1. **Socratic Resume Alignment and Tailoring** – Aligns verified experience with a target job description.  
2. **Socratic Job Fit Analysis and Cover Letter Planning** – Identifies qualification gaps and builds a strategic cover letter framework.  
3. **Socratic Cover Letter Voice and Narrative Development** – Refines tone, structure, and storytelling to craft an authentic narrative voice.

The orchestration process pauses at key checkpoints for user confirmation, saves progress, and can resume at any stage.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Initialization and Orientation

**Goal:** Introduce the full process, confirm available materials, and set expectations.  
**Method:**  
- Verify that the user has a job description and relevant resumes/CVs.  
- Present concise summaries of the three sub-skills and their outputs:  
  - **Resume Alignment:** Refines existing materials to fit the job description.  
  - **Job Fit & Planning:** Identifies missing qualifications and builds a cover letter plan.  
  - **Voice & Narrative:** Shapes tone, structure, and story for the final letter.  
- Ask where the user wants to begin (default: resume alignment).  

**Output:**  
An **Application Readiness Summary**, clarifying goals, inputs, and target outcomes.

### Phase 2: Resume Alignment and Tailoring (Sub-skill Activation)

**Purpose:** Align verified experience and skills with the job description.  
**Pre-Activation Brief:**  
- Analyze the job posting for key priorities and competencies.  
- Review multiple resumes/CVs, preferring the most recent versions.  
- When overlaps exist, present both recent and earlier phrasings for user choice.  
- Confirm any inferred experiences before inclusion.  

**Output:**  
A **Tailored Resume Framework** — verified, job-specific, and strategically aligned.  

**Transition Prompt:**  
> “Would you like to analyze the job description further for qualification gaps and begin cover letter planning?”

### Phase 3: Job Fit Analysis and Cover Letter Planning (Sub-skill Activation)

**Purpose:** Examine the job description for alignment gaps and develop a strategic plan for the cover letter.  
**Pre-Activation Brief:**  
- Extract and clarify core qualifications, values, and expectations.  
- Compare each requirement with verified resume data to find full, partial, or missing matches.  
- Identify and rank stretch areas by importance.  
- Present 2–3 reframing options for each stretch area, confirming all phrasing with the user.  
- Conclude by creating a high-level cover letter plan emphasizing verified strengths and authentic reframing.  

**Output:**  
A **Job Application Narrative Map**, connecting experience with strategic storytelling opportunities.  

**Transition Prompt:**  
> “Would you like to explore tone, structure, and narrative voice for your cover letter?”

---

### Phase 4: Cover Letter Voice and Narrative Development (Sub-skill Activation)

**Purpose:** Capture the author’s authentic voice and design the narrative architecture for the cover letter.  
**Pre-Activation Brief:**  
- Review previous cover letters for tone, rhythm, and reusable content.  
- Identify contextual phrases or paragraphs that might inform the new letter.  
- Analyze stylistic tendencies (warmth, formality, rhythm, flow).  
- Brainstorm narrative threads through Socratic inquiry, exploring meaning and emotional resonance.  
- Optionally choose between **pure Socratic structure design** or **collaborative outline generation**.  
- End with a reflective authenticity review before drafting.  

**Output:**  
A **Validated Cover Letter Narrative Framework**, ready for drafting or refinement.

---

### Phase 5: Reflection and Integration

**Purpose:** Synthesize insights across all three sub-skills into a coherent long-term professional story.  
**Method:**  
- Review key outputs from resume, job fit, and narrative phases.  
- Ask reflective questions such as:  
  > “Do these materials represent the professional story you want to tell?”  
  > “What core themes or values consistently emerge across your experiences?”  
- Compile transferable insights for use in future applications or interviews.  

**Output:**  
A **Career Narrative Integration Summary**, serving as a reusable foundation for professional storytelling.

---

### Phase 6: Resume & Recall Checkpoints

**Purpose:** Preserve continuity and allow resumption at any point.  
**Method:**  
- Save progress at every phase, including uploaded materials, selected reframings, and approved tone preferences.  
- On re-entry, summarize last known progress and ask:  
  > “Would you like to resume, revisit, or refine your previous stage?”  

**Output:**  
An **Application Continuity Log**, ensuring each new application builds on prior work rather than starting over.

---

## When to Revisit Earlier Phases

Revisit earlier stages when:  
- A new job description or version of a resume is introduced.  
- The tone or emphasis in a cover letter shifts significantly.  
- Reflection reveals new themes worth integrating across materials.  

Returning to prior phases deepens clarity, authenticity, and strategic alignment.
