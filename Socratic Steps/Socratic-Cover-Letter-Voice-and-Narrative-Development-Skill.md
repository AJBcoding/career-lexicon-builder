## Overview

Guide the user through refining tone, structure, and narrative meaning for a new cover letter by examining past letters, analyzing authorial voice, and developing an authentic narrative through Socratic inquiry.

**Core principle:** Build continuity between past writing and new opportunity while fostering deeper reflection on the story the user wants to tell. Encourage authenticity, emotional resonance, and strategic coherence.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Context and Input Gathering

**Goal:** Establish the foundation by reviewing the job description and any previous cover letters.  
**Method:**  
- Confirm the target job description and cover letter plan.  
- Ask whether the user wants to maintain continuity with previous tone or explore a new stylistic direction.  
- Review past cover letters to understand purpose, tone, and outcomes.  

**Output:**  
A **Context Map** outlining available materials, stylistic goals, and desired direction for the new letter.

---

### Phase 2: Content Relevance Review

**Goal:** Identify sections from past cover letters that might be reusable or adaptable.  
**Method:**  
- Read each previous letter carefully.  
- Present potentially relevant excerpts **in context**, showing surrounding lines for tone and meaning.  
- Ask Socratic confirmation questions, e.g.:  
  > “This paragraph highlights collaboration — could this experience be relevant to your new role?”  
- Confirm or reject each section’s relevance.  

**Output:**  
A **Confirmed Content List** of ideas, sentences, or paragraphs that may be repurposed.

### Phase 3: Tone and Structural Analysis

**Goal:** Capture the author’s authentic voice, rhythm, and structural habits.  
**Method:**  
- Analyze tone (warm, formal, reflective, persuasive), rhythm (sentence length, pacing), and structure (how the letter opens, develops, and closes).  
- Ask reflective questions such as:  
  > “Does this tone still reflect how you speak about your work?”  
- Document observed stylistic tendencies and note any tone adjustments desired for the new context.  

**Output:**  
A **Voice and Structure Profile** summarizing tone, rhythm, pacing, and preferred structural patterns.

---

### Phase 4: Narrative Brainstorming

**Goal:** Generate possible narrative through-lines for the new cover letter.  
**Method:**  
- Begin with open-ended Socratic prompts, e.g.:  
  > “What story feels most true or meaningful for this opportunity?”  
- Allow for multiple ideas or thematic threads.  
- After initial brainstorming, introduce **narrative archetypes** (e.g., transformation, alignment, innovation, journey, service) to refine focus.  

**Output:**  
A **Set of Narrative Threads**, each representing a potential story or thematic approach.

---

### Phase 5: Narrative Exploration and Integration

**Goal:** Explore each narrative thread Socratically and identify points of connection.  
**Method:**  
- Explore each idea in depth, asking why it matters, what experiences illustrate it, and how it aligns with the role.  
- Example prompts:  
  > “What experience best illustrates this theme in action?”  
  > “Why is this story particularly resonant for this institution or audience?”  
- Once each idea is fully developed, visualize integrations (e.g., “Mentorship as foundation, innovation as outcome”).  

**Output:**  
An **Integrated Narrative Map** showing how themes can combine into one coherent story arc.

---

### Phase 6: Structure and Tone Framing (Dual Path Option)

**Goal:** Define the overall structure and tone direction for the new cover letter.  
**Method:**  
- Offer two process options:  
  - **Option A (Pure Socratic):** Continue questioning to let the user design the structure themselves.  
  - **Option B (Collaborative):** Present 2–3 structural outlines based on prior discussion for review and refinement.  
- Present tone variations side by side — one preserving the author’s historical voice, one adapted to the job’s culture — for user choice.  

**Output:**  
A **Cover Letter Structural Blueprint**, defining both the flow and tonal balance.

---

### Phase 7: Reflective Authenticity Review

**Goal:** Confirm that the final framework aligns with the user’s authentic professional voice and emotional truth.  
**Method:**  
- Ask reflective, emotionally grounded questions, e.g.:  
  > “Does this narrative sound like your real voice?”  
  > “Is there anything that feels performative or less genuine?”  
- Adjust the structure or tone as needed for full authenticity before drafting begins.  

**Output:**  
A **Validated Narrative Framework**, ready for the drafting stage — authentic, coherent, and resonant.

## When to Revisit Earlier Phases

Revisit when:  
- New cover letter examples or drafts become available.  
- The user changes tone or narrative emphasis.  
- Multiple narrative threads need rebalancing.  

Returning to earlier stages deepens insight and ensures a voice that feels both genuine and strategically aligned.
