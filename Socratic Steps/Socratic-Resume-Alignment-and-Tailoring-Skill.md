# Socratic Resume Alignment and Tailoring Skill

## Overview

Align and tailor professional resumes or CVs to specific job descriptions through Socratic questioning, verified evidence, and collaborative refinement.

**Core principle:** Ask structured questions to clarify job priorities and match them precisely to verified past experience. Never fabricate experience. Preference is given to more recent resume versions unless earlier material provides stronger alignment.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Job Understanding Dialogue

**Goal:** Establish a shared understanding of the job description’s intent, priorities, and tone.  
**Method:** Ask one question at a time — often multiple choice — to clarify:  
- Core responsibilities and competencies  
- Keywords and required qualifications  
- Tone, culture, and implied expectations  
- Non-negotiables vs. “nice-to-haves”  

**Output:**  
A concise **Job Alignment Map** — identifying the job’s explicit and implicit priorities.

### Phase 2: Resume and CV Intake

**Goal:** Understand and organize the user’s existing materials.  
**Method:**  
- Review multiple resumes or CVs.  
- Identify and timestamp job entries, roles, and skill mentions.  
- Prefer **most recent versions** unless an earlier one better matches the job.  
- When overlap exists, **present both versions side by side** for user choice.  

**Output:**  
A **Chronological-Comparative Resume Index** of all relevant material from uploaded resumes.

---

### Phase 3: Experience Relevance Analysis

**Goal:** Identify which roles, projects, and achievements best align with the target job.  
**Method:**  
- Compare the Job Alignment Map to the Resume Index.  
- Highlight potential matches between the job’s requirements and past experiences.  
- Ask confirmation questions for inferred or ambiguous skills, e.g.:  
  > “In your role as Communications Director, did you also manage media relations?”  
- Never fabricate. All content must trace directly to verified resume material.  

**Output:**  
A **Relevance Matrix** showing the connection between job requirements and confirmed experiences.

---

### Phase 4: Draft Framework Creation

**Goal:** Build the first-level outline for the tailored resume.  
**Method:**  
- Assemble confirmed experiences and skills into a structured outline:  
  - Header and summary section (aligned with tone)  
  - Core professional experience  
  - Supporting sections (education, service, awards, etc.)  
- Present **original excerpts beside proposed rewrites** for approval.  

**Output:**  
A **Resume Framework Outline**, establishing order and emphasis before drafting.

---

### Phase 5: Collaborative Resume Drafting

**Goal:** Transform the framework into a customized, plain-text draft.  
**Method:**  
- Draft section-by-section (100–150 words each).  
- Present both **original and revised versions** for comparison.  
- Ask after each:  
  > “Does this reflect your voice and the job’s expectations?”  
- Adjust collaboratively while preserving factual accuracy.  

**Output:**  
A **Plain-Text Tailored Resume Draft**, ready for user formatting or submission.

---

### Phase 6: Reflective Authenticity Review

**Goal:** Ensure the tailored resume reflects the user’s authentic professional narrative.  
**Method:**  
- Ask reflective questions to confirm tone and emphasis:  
  - “Does this version feel authentic to how you describe your work?”  
  - “Would you like to emphasize teaching, leadership, or collaboration more strongly?”  
- Return to earlier phases as needed for realignment.  

**Output:**  
A **Final Verified Resume Draft** — strategically aligned, factually accurate, and authentic.

---

### Phase 7: Optional Adaptation for Multiple Roles

**Goal:** Enable reconfiguration for similar or related positions.  
**Method:**  
- Save the relevance matrix and framework as modular templates.  
- Ask:  
  > “Would you like to adapt this resume for a related position?”  

**Output:**  
A **Resume Adaptation Template** for efficient future tailoring.

## When to Revisit Earlier Phases

Revisit when:  
- Job priorities or focus areas shift mid-process.  
- A new resume version or missing detail emerges.  
- A section feels tonally inconsistent or underrepresented.  

Returning to earlier steps ensures stronger alignment and integrity.

- Ask before including implied or inferred experience.  
- Build clarity, authenticity, and alignment through dialogue.
