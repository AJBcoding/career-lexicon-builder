# Example Lexicon Outputs

This directory contains sample lexicons generated by the Phase 3 LLM-based analysis system.

## Sample Files

These lexicons were generated from 3 career documents to demonstrate what the full system produces:

- **SAMPLE_01_career_philosophy.md** - Meta-level themes about leadership, values, and problem-solving approach
- **SAMPLE_02_achievement_library.md** - Major achievements with multiple variations by emphasis
- **SAMPLE_03_narrative_patterns.md** - Story structures, formulas, and templates for career communications
- **SAMPLE_04_language_bank.md** - Action verbs, phrases, and terminology library

## Source Documents (3 PDFs)

- 2024-11-25 - UCLA cover letter v. 2.pdf (5 pages, Dean position)
- 2025-10-13 - Byrnes, Anthony Resume - Colburn School submitted.pdf (3 pages)
- 2023-02-25 - CSULB cover letter.pdf (7 pages, Dean position)

## Purpose

These samples demonstrate:
1. The hierarchical structure and organization of generated lexicons
2. The level of detail and actionable guidance provided
3. How source citations and evidence work
4. The quality of interpretive analysis vs literal pattern matching

## Generating Your Own Lexicons

To generate complete lexicons from all your career documents:

```bash
# Set up API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run the analysis
python3 run_llm_analysis.py
```

Your lexicons will be generated in `lexicons_llm/` with the same structure as these samples.

## Cost & Performance

- **Sample generation (3 docs):** ~$0.30, 1-2 minutes
- **Full generation (37 docs):** ~$1-2, 3-4 minutes
