## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, and I'm equipped to:

- **Find files** using glob patterns across your project
- **Search code** with powerful regex patterns through file contents
- **Read files** when you know the specific paths you need
- **Execute file operations** like listing directories and copying files

I can see you're working in `/Users/anthonybyrnes/PycharmProjects/Python419`, which is a Git repository on the main branch with various Python files, XSLT configurations, and test files.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? Just let me know:
- Specific files or patterns you're looking for
- Code snippets or functionality you need to find
- How thoroughly you'd like me to search (quick scan vs. deep dive)

I'm ready when you are!

## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'll help you add the obra/superpowers-marketplace plugin. Let me execute this slash command for you.

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

I see that `/plugin` is not a prompt-based slash command that I can execute through the SlashCommand tool. The `/plugin` command appears to be a built-in CLI command that needs to be run directly in your terminal.

You can run this command directly in your terminal:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

If you're trying to add a plugin marketplace or MCP server to Claude Code, you might want to check the Claude Code documentation for the correct syntax. Would you like me to look up information about how to add plugins or MCP servers to Claude Code?
