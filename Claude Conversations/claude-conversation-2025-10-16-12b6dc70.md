# In Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace

## ðŸ¤– Claude

I can see you're trying to use plugin commands in Claude Code. However, those commands don't appear to be valid Claude Code commands.

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Claude Code doesn't have `/plugin marketplace add` or `/plugin install` commands. The available slash commands are documented and include built-in commands like `/help`, `/config`, `/model`, etc., plus support for custom commands and MCP integrations.

You can see all available commands by typing `/help` or create custom commands in `.claude/commands/` directory.

## ðŸ‘¤ User

what version of claude am I running?

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Claude Code version 2.0.19

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User

update claude

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Claude Code is already up to date at version 2.0.19.

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User

/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

That's not a valid Claude Code command. Claude Code doesn't have a `/plugin marketplace add` command.

You can see all available commands by typing `/help`. If you're looking to extend Claude Code functionality, you can:

1. Create custom slash commands in `.claude/commands/`
2. Use MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations
3. Check the official documentation for supported extensions

## ðŸ¤– Claude

You can use MCP (Model Context Protocol) to extend Claude Code functionality. MCP servers can provide additional tools and commands.

To set up MCP integrations, you'll need to configure them in your Claude Code settings. You can access settings with `/config` or by editing the configuration files directly.

MCP commands become available as `/mcp__server-name__command-name` once a server is connected.

## ðŸ‘¤ User

/plugin

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

`/plugin` is not a valid Claude Code command. 

Type `/help` to see all available slash commands, or check the documentation for how to extend Claude Code with MCP integrations or custom commands.
