## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I can help you:

- **Find files** using glob patterns across your project
- **Search code contents** with regex patterns
- **Read and analyze** specific files
- **Navigate your codebase** efficiently

Your project appears to be a career lexicon builder system with LLM-based analysis capabilities. I can see you have:
- Multiple analyzer modules (keywords, LLM-based)
- Generator modules (hierarchical)
- Test and conversion scripts
- Documentation and design artifacts
- Sample documents for career philosophy, achievements, narratives, and language banks

I'm ready whenever you have a search request. Just let me know:
1. What you're looking for
2. How thorough you'd like the search (quick/standard/deep)
3. Any specific file patterns or code patterns you're interested in

What would you like me to search for?
