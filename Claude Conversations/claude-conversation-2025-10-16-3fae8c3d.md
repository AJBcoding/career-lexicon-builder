## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist.

I can help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code and text with regex patterns
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate your codebase efficiently

Your project is located at: `/Users/anthonybyrnes/PycharmProjects/Python419`

It's a Git repository on the main branch. I can see you have various Python files, XML files, XSLT stylesheets, and test files in your project.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
