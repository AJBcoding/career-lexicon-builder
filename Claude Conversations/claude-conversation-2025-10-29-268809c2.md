Warmup

---

## ü§ñ Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! I can assist with:

- **Finding files** using glob patterns
- **Searching code contents** with regex patterns
- **Reading specific files** when you know the path
- **Analyzing file structure** and relationships

Your current project `/Users/anthonybyrnes/PycharmProjects/career-lexicon-builder` appears to be undergoing reorganization - I see deleted files and new directories like `analyzers/`, `core/`, `generators/`, and `utils/`.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?

---

## üë§ User

Read DevArtifacts/HANDOFF-PHASE-2.md. We completed Phase 1 (55 tests passing). Please implement Phase 2: confidence_scorer.py, document_processor.py, and 
  state_manager.py following the implementation plan.

---

## ü§ñ Claude

I'll start by reading the handoff document to understand the Phase 2 requirements and implementation plan.

I'm using the **executing-plans** skill to execute the Phase 2 implementation plan in controlled batches with review checkpoints.

# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch
**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report
When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue
Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess

## ü§ñ Claude

I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan.

Let me first review the implementation plan document to get the detailed implementation steps for Phase 2.

---

## ü§ñ Claude

Let me read more of the implementation document to see the detailed steps:

---

## ü§ñ Claude

Now let me verify the current project state and then create a plan:

---

## ü§ñ Claude

Perfect! Phase 1 is solid with 55 tests passing. Now let me create a plan for Phase 2 implementation:

---

## ü§ñ Claude

## Plan Review

I've reviewed both the handoff document and the implementation plan. Phase 2 requires implementing three core modules:

1. **confidence_scorer.py** - Confidence scoring utility (independent, simple)
2. **document_processor.py** - Document classification with pattern matching  
3. **state_manager.py** - Processing state and manifest management

The plan is clear and comprehensive. I'll execute in 3 batches following the handoff document's recommended order.

---

## Batch 1: Confidence Scorer (Tasks 1-4)

Starting implementation now.

---

## ü§ñ Claude

Perfect! **Batch 1 Complete: Confidence Scorer**

## What Was Implemented

**Files created:**
- `core/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `core/confidence_scorer.py` - Confidence scoring utilities (138 lines)
- `tests/test_confidence_scorer.py` - Comprehensive test suite (251 lines)

**Functions implemented:**
1. `calculate_confidence(criteria, weights)` - Weighted confidence averaging with clamping
2. `should_flag_for_review(confidence, threshold)` - Review flagging helper
3. `get_confidence_category(confidence)` - Categorization helper (high/medium/low)

## Test Results

```
‚úÖ 77 tests passing (55 from Phase 1 + 22 new)
- Equal weights scenarios
- Custom weights with varying configurations
- Edge cases (clamping, empty criteria, zero weights)
- Weight normalization
- All helper functions
- Docstring examples verified
```

## Verification Output

All tests pass in 0.39s:
- Phase 1 tests: 55/55 ‚úÖ
- Confidence scorer tests: 22/22 ‚úÖ

The confidence scorer is production-ready and can be used by document_processor for classification confidence scoring.

---

Ready for feedback.

---

## üë§ User

is phase 2 complete?

---

## ü§ñ Claude

No, Phase 2 is not yet complete. I've only finished **Batch 1** of 3 batches.

## Current Status

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ `core/confidence_scorer.py` (22 tests passing)

**Still To Do:**
- ‚ùå `core/document_processor.py` - Document classification with pattern matching
- ‚ùå `core/state_manager.py` - Processing state and manifest management

## Progress: 4/11 tasks complete (36%)

According to the implementation plan, Phase 2 has 3 main deliverables:
1. **Confidence Scorer** ‚úÖ Done
2. **Document Processor** ‚è≥ Next
3. **State Manager** ‚è≥ After that

Would you like me to continue with Batch 2 (implementing `document_processor.py`)?

---

## üë§ User

Yes.

---

## ü§ñ Claude

## Batch 2: Document Processor (Tasks 5-7)

Starting implementation now.

---

## ü§ñ Claude

I need to fix two test failures. Let me update the code:

---

## ü§ñ Claude

Perfect! **Batch 2 Complete: Document Processor**

## What Was Implemented

**Files created:**
- `core/document_processor.py` - Document classification module (277 lines)
- `tests/test_document_processor.py` - Comprehensive test suite (294 lines)

**Classes & Functions implemented:**
1. `DocumentType` enum - RESUME, COVER_LETTER, JOB_DESCRIPTION, UNKNOWN
2. `classify_by_filename(filename)` - Filename pattern matching
3. `classify_by_content(text)` - Content-based classification with scoring
4. `classify_document(filepath, text)` - Main API combining both approaches

**Classification Features:**
- **Resume detection**: Section headers (Experience, Education, Skills), date ranges, bullet-heavy structure, contact info
- **Cover letter detection**: Salutations (Dear...), closings (Sincerely...), first-person phrases, paragraph-heavy structure
- **Job description detection**: Company voice (we are seeking, we offer), requirements/responsibilities sections
- **Confidence scoring**: Returns confidence level and reasoning for every classification

## Test Results

```
‚úÖ 104 tests passing (55 Phase 1 + 22 confidence_scorer + 27 document_processor)
- Enum values
- Filename patterns (resume, CV, cover letter, job descriptions)
- Content analysis (clear examples, ambiguous cases, edge cases)
- Full document classification with priority logic
- Edge cases (empty text, short text, conflicting signals)
```

## Verification Output

All tests pass in 0.24s:
- Phase 1 tests: 55/55 ‚úÖ
- Confidence scorer tests: 22/22 ‚úÖ  
- Document processor tests: 27/27 ‚úÖ

The document classifier is production-ready and provides detailed reasoning with every classification.
