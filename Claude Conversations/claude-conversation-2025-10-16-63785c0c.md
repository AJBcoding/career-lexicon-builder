## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for Claude's CLI.

I can efficiently help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code and text with regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate your Python419 project

The repository is on the `main` branch and appears to be a project involving XML import processing, XSLT transformations, and testing.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?

 /plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace

## ðŸ¤– Claude

I can see you're working with the superpowers marketplace plugin. Let me help you add it.

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

It looks like this is a CLI command that should be run directly in your terminal rather than through me. Based on the local command output I can see in your messages, you've already successfully removed the marketplace, so you should be able to run:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

directly in your Claude Code CLI to add it back.

## ðŸ‘¤ User

 /plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

I see the issue - the `/plugin` command is a built-in CLI command that you need to execute directly in your terminal, not through me. 

You should run this command directly in your Claude Code CLI:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

Just type or paste that command at your Claude Code prompt and it will add the superpowers marketplace.
