## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist.

I can help you:

- **Find files** using glob patterns (e.g., `*.js`, `src/**/*.tsx`)
- **Search code contents** with regex patterns
- **Read specific files** when you know the path
- **Explore directory structures** with bash commands

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? Just let me know:
1. What you're looking for
2. Any specific directories or file types to focus on
3. How thorough you'd like the search to be

I'm ready when you are!
