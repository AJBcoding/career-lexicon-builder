## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I can help you:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code and text with regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate your codebase efficiently

I can see you're working in the `/Users/anthonybyrnes/PycharmProjects/Python419` directory, which is a Git repository on the main branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
