Warmup

---

## ü§ñ Claude

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for your codebase.

I can see you're working on a **Career Lexicon Builder** project with significant recent changes. The git status shows:

- Several files have been deleted (marked with `D`)
- Some files modified, including `requirements.txt` and `tests/test_document_processor.py`
- Many new untracked directories and files (`??`) including:
  - `analyzers/`, `core/`, `generators/`, `utils/` directories
  - Various test files for new modules
  - Development artifacts and handoff documentation

**What would you like me to do?** I can help you:

1. **Search for specific files** - Find files by name or pattern using glob
2. **Search code contents** - Find specific code or patterns using regex/grep
3. **Read files** - View the contents of specific files
4. **Explore the structure** - Map out your codebase organization
5. **Analyze changes** - Understand what's new, deleted, or modified

Just let me know what you're looking for or what aspect of your codebase you'd like to explore!

please review the Handoff-phase-4-start-here - the phase 3 tests were completed.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** Superpowers now uses Claude Code's skills system. Custom skills in ~/.config/superpowers/skills will not be read. Move custom skills to ~/.claude/skills instead. To make this message go away, remove ~/.config/superpowers/skills

I'll review the Phase 4 handoff document for you.

---

## ü§ñ Claude

Perfect! I've reviewed the Phase 4 handoff document. Here's a summary:

## Phase 4 Status Summary

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Phase 3 COMPLETE - 256+ tests passing in ~29 seconds
- ‚úÖ All 4 analyzers implemented (Themes, Qualifications, Narratives, Keywords)
- ‚è≥ Phase 4 ready to start

**Phase 4 Goal:**
Build 4 lexicon generators that transform analyzer outputs into human-readable markdown reference documents:

1. **Themes Lexicon Generator** ‚Üí `my_values.md` (personal values reference)
2. **Qualifications Lexicon Generator** ‚Üí `resume_variations.md` (bullet point evolution tracker)
3. **Narratives Lexicon Generator** ‚Üí `storytelling_patterns.md` (rhetorical device catalog)
4. **Keywords Lexicon Generator** ‚Üí `usage_index.md` (cross-referenced keyword lookup)

**Implementation Plan:**
The document provides a detailed 4-batch implementation plan:
- **Batch 1:** Setup + Themes Generator (1-1.5h)
- **Batch 2:** Qualifications + Narratives (1.5-2h)  
- **Batch 3:** Keywords Generator (1h)
- **Batch 4:** Integration + Polish (0.5-1h)

**Total Estimate:** 3-4 hours

**Key Features:**
- TDD approach (write tests first)
- Helper utilities in `templates/formatting_utils.py`
- Target ~280-300 total tests passing
- No new dependencies needed
- Clear markdown output specifications provided

The handoff document is extremely thorough with example code, sample tests, and specific requirements for each generator.

**Would you like me to start implementing Phase 4, or do you have questions about the plan first?**

## üë§ User

start implementing phase 4

---

## ü§ñ Claude

I'll start implementing Phase 4. Let me first check for relevant skills to ensure I follow the best approach.

# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch
**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report
When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue
Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess

## ü§ñ Claude

I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan.

Let me first verify the current state and then create a TodoWrite plan for the batches.

## üë§ User

Let's move on.

---

## ü§ñ Claude

Perfect! Moving on to **Batch 3: Keywords Generator**.

---

## ü§ñ Claude

I see the issue - the keywords are bolded in the output (which is correct per the design), but the tests are looking for the unbolded text. Let me fix the tests to account for the bolding:

---
