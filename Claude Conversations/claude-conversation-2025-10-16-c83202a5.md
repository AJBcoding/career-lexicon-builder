## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for your codebase at `/Users/anthonybyrnes/PycharmProjects/Python419`.

I can assist you with:

- **Finding files** using glob patterns to match file names and paths
- **Searching code** with regex patterns to locate specific content
- **Reading files** when you need to examine specific file contents
- **Analyzing your codebase** structure and dependencies

I see you're working on a Python project with:
- Schedule import/report processing functionality
- XSLT transformations for XML/JSON conversion
- Test files for header filtering
- Import reports in XML format

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
