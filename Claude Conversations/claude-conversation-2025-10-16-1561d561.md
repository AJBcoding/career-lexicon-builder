## ðŸ¤– Claude

Ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for your codebase at `/Users/anthonybyrnes/PycharmProjects/Python419`.

I can assist you with:

- **Glob searches** - Finding files matching patterns
- **Grep searches** - Searching file contents with regex
- **Read operations** - Examining specific file contents
- **Bash operations** - Listing directories and file operations

Your repository is currently on the `main` branch with various modified and untracked files, including Python scripts, XSLT files, and test files.

What would you like to search for or explore in your codebase?
