# Archived: Skill-Based Implementation

**Archive Date**: 2025-10-29

## What Was Archived

This directory contains the initial implementation (Phases 1-4) that focused on skill extraction and job fit analysis. While functional and well-tested (151/151 tests passing), it did not align with the design document's intent.

## What Was Built

### Modules
- `term_extractor.py` - Extract skills, tools, methodologies from text
- `context_analyzer.py` - Analyze term prominence and action verbs
- `term_categorizer.py` - Categorize terms by skill domain and role
- `lexicon_builder.py` - Aggregate skills across documents with scoring
- `gap_analyzer.py` - Compare skills against job requirements
- `document_processor.py` - Document classification (resume/cover letter/job description)
- `text_extractor.py` - Extract text from PDF, DOCX, plain text

### Test Suite
- 151 tests passing
- Comprehensive coverage of all modules

### Focus
This implementation focused on:
- Identifying WHAT skills you have
- Analyzing job fit and gaps
- Providing quantitative scoring (recency, frequency, prominence)

## Why Archived

The design document and implementation plan specify a different focus:
- Extract HOW you've phrased/positioned content (quotes, bullet variations)
- Capture storytelling structures, metaphors, rhetorical devices
- Build reference lexicons for writing NEW materials
- Generate markdown lexicons with quoted examples

## Status

Complete and functional, but solving a different problem than designed for.
