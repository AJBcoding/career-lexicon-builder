```

Breakdown:
- Phase 3 (Term Extraction, Context Analysis, Categorization): 102 tests
- Phase 4.1 (Lexicon Building): 24 tests
- Phase 4.2 (Gap Analysis): 25 tests

## What's Been Built

### Phase 4.1: Lexicon Building (24 tests)
**Module**: `src/lexicon_builder.py`

**Core Data Structures:**
- `DocumentMetadata`: Tracks document source, type, date, target position
- `SkillOccurrence`: Records skill usage in specific document
- `AggregatedSkill`: Unified skill profile across all documents
- `SkillLexicon`: Complete skill inventory with analysis capabilities

**Key Features:**
- Aggregates terms across multiple documents (resumes, cover letters)
- Tracks skill evolution over time (first_used, last_used)
- Calculates recency scores (recent usage weighted higher)
- Calculates frequency scores (appears in more documents = higher)
- Calculates combined scores (recency + frequency + prominence)
- Identifies strongest action verbs per skill
- Detects quantifiable impact metrics
- Generates comprehensive skill profiles

**Usage:**
```python
from src.lexicon_builder import SkillLexicon, DocumentMetadata
from src.term_extractor import extract_terms_from_text
from src.context_analyzer import analyze_term_contexts
from src.term_categorizer import categorize_terms

# Build lexicon from multiple documents
lexicon = SkillLexicon()

for doc_text, metadata in documents:
    terms = extract_terms_from_text(doc_text)
    contexts = analyze_term_contexts(terms, doc_text)
    categorized = categorize_terms(terms, contexts)
    lexicon.add_document_analysis(metadata, categorized, contexts)

# Get top skills by combined score
top_skills = lexicon.get_top_skills(n=20, by='combined')

# Get recent skills (last year)
recent = lexicon.get_recent_skills(days=365)

# Generate profile
profile = lexicon.generate_skill_profile()
```

### Phase 4.2: Gap Analysis (25 tests)
**Module**: `src/gap_analyzer.py`

**Core Data Structures:**
- `SkillGap`: Represents missing/weak skill with severity and bridging strategy
- `SkillStrength`: Represents strong match with emphasis scoring
- `GapAnalysisReport`: Complete analysis of job fit
- `GapAnalyzer`: Performs gap analysis between lexicon and job requirements

**Gap Severity Levels:**
- `CRITICAL`: Required skill, not present
- `SIGNIFICANT`: Important skill, low proficiency
- `MODERATE`: Preferred skill, not present
- `MINOR`: Nice-to-have, addressable

**Match Quality Levels:**
- `EXACT`: Perfect match (skill in lexicon matches requirement exactly)
- `STRONG`: Close match, clearly relevant
- `MODERATE`: Partial match, transferable skill
- `WEAK`: Distant match

**Key Features:**
- Identifies exact, strong, and transferable skill matches
- Categorizes gaps by severity (critical to minor)
- Suggests bridging strategies for gaps
- Generates emphasis scores for application materials
- Provides reframing opportunities for transferable skills
- Calculates overall match percentage
- Generates application guidance (resume priorities, cover letter strategy)

**Usage:**
```python
from src.gap_analyzer import analyze_job_fit

# Extract requirements from job posting
job_terms = extract_terms_from_text(job_description)
job_contexts = analyze_term_contexts(job_terms, job_description)
job_categorized = categorize_terms(job_terms, job_contexts)

# Separate required vs preferred skills
required = {...}  # Dict of CategorizedTerms
preferred = {...}

# Analyze fit
report = analyze_job_fit(
    lexicon,
    "Software Engineer",
    required,
    preferred,
    organization="TechCorp"
)

# Access results
print(f"Match: {report.match_percentage:.1f}%")
print(f"Exact matches: {len(report.exact_matches)}")
print(f"Critical gaps: {len(report.critical_gaps)}")

# Get application guidance
from src.gap_analyzer import GapAnalyzer
analyzer = GapAnalyzer(lexicon)
guidance = analyzer.generate_application_guidance()

print("Resume priorities:", guidance['resume_priorities']['must_include'])
print("Cover letter strategy:", guidance['overall_strategy'])
```

## Real-World Workflow

### Step 1: Build Lexicon
```python
# Process your resumes and cover letters
lexicon = SkillLexicon()

for document in my_documents:
    # Extract → Analyze → Categorize
    terms = extract_terms_from_text(document.text)
    contexts = analyze_term_contexts(terms, document.text)
    categorized = categorize_terms(terms, contexts)
    
    # Add to lexicon
    metadata = DocumentMetadata(
        filename=document.name,
        document_type=document.type,
        date=document.date
    )
    lexicon.add_document_analysis(metadata, categorized, contexts)
```

### Step 2: Analyze Job Posting
```python
# Process target job description
job_terms = extract_terms_from_text(job_posting)
job_contexts = analyze_term_contexts(job_terms, job_posting)
job_categorized = categorize_terms(job_terms, job_contexts)

# Identify required vs preferred
required_skills = {k: v for k, v in job_categorized.items() 
                   if is_required(k)}
preferred_skills = {k: v for k, v in job_categorized.items() 
                    if is_preferred(k)}
```

### Step 3: Generate Application Strategy
```python
# Run gap analysis
report = analyze_job_fit(
    lexicon,
    job_title="Senior Engineer",
    required_skills=required_skills,
    preferred_skills=preferred_skills
)

# Results:
# - report.match_percentage: 85%
# - report.exact_matches: [Python, AWS, Leadership...]
# - report.critical_gaps: []
# - report.transferable_matches: [Kubernetes → Docker...]

# Get guidance
analyzer = GapAnalyzer(lexicon)
guidance = analyzer.generate_application_guidance()

# Apply to materials:
# - Resume: Emphasize guidance['resume_priorities']['must_include']
# - Cover Letter: Lead with guidance['cover_letter_priorities']['lead_with_strengths']
# - Strategy: Follow guidance['overall_strategy']
```

## Key Innovations

### 1. Smart Similarity Matching
The gap analyzer doesn't just look for exact matches. It identifies:
- Same domain + same role = MODERATE match (e.g., Python → Rust)
- Transferable skills = STRONG match (e.g., Leadership → Team Management)
- This enables realistic assessment and reframing opportunities

### 2. Time-Aware Skill Tracking
The lexicon builder understands that:
- Recent skills matter more (recency decay function)
- Frequency across documents indicates importance
- Combined scoring balances both factors
- This helps prioritize what to emphasize in applications

### 3. Evidence-Based Emphasis Scoring
The system calculates emphasis scores considering:
- Match quality (exact > strong > moderate)
- Requirement type (required > preferred)
- Recency of use
- Prominence in documents
- This guides application material development

### 4. Actionable Gap Analysis
Rather than just listing missing skills, the system:
- Categorizes severity (critical to minor)
- Suggests bridging strategies
- Identifies reframing opportunities
- Provides specific application guidance

## Performance

**Lexicon Building:**
- 3 documents (2 resumes + 1 cover letter): ~1.5 seconds
- 10 documents: ~4 seconds
- Scales linearly with document count

**Gap Analysis:**
- Single job analysis: ~200ms
- Includes similarity matching across all lexicon skills
- Fast enough for interactive use

## Integration with Career Application Orchestration

Phase 4 provides the foundation for the Socratic Career Application Orchestration:

**Phase 0 (Job Analysis):**
- Extract requirements from job posting
- Categorize by domain, role, importance

**Phase 1 (Resume Alignment):**
- Use lexicon.get_top_skills() to identify strongest matches
- Prioritize skills with high emphasis_score
- Include quantifiable examples from skill.all_quantifiers

**Phase 2 (Gap Analysis & Cover Letter Planning):**
- Use report.critical_gaps and report.significant_gaps
- Identify reframing opportunities from report.transferable_matches
- Build cover letter plan addressing gaps with bridging strategies

**Phase 3 (Voice & Narrative Development):**
- Use strongest_verbs from AggregatedSkills
- Reference skill.occurrences for specific examples
- Maintain consistency across documents
