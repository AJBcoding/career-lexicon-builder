**Note**: Phase 3 uses only Python standard library for term extraction. No additional NLP libraries (like spaCy or NLTK) were required thanks to pattern-based extraction.

---

## Technical Decisions & Design Patterns

### 1. Pattern-Based vs. ML-Based Extraction

**Decision**: Use pattern-based extraction with regex and predefined skill databases

**Rationale**:
- **Simpler**: No model training or large dependencies
- **Faster**: Regex matching is very fast
- **Deterministic**: Predictable behavior
- **Maintainable**: Easy to add new skills
- **Sufficient**: Covers vast majority of career terms

**Trade-offs**:
- May miss non-standard terminology
- Requires manual curation of skill lists
- Less flexible than ML approaches

**Future Enhancement**: Could add ML-based extraction for unknown terms

### 2. Confidence Scoring Algorithm

**Formula**:
```python
confidence = category_confidence + frequency_boost

where:
- category_confidence: 0.3-0.95 based on term type
- frequency_boost: min(0.3, frequency/max_freq * 0.3)
```

**Design rationale**:
- Known categories (languages, certifications) get high base scores
- Frequency provides additional confidence
- Cap prevents over-confidence from repetition

### 3. Prominence Scoring Multi-Factor Approach

**Components**:
1. **Position** (30%): Earlier mentions are more prominent
2. **Frequency** (30%): More mentions indicate importance
3. **Confidence** (20%): Term recognition certainty
4. **Structure** (20%): Context bonuses (bullets, headers)

**Design rationale**:
- Balances multiple signals
- Position matters (resume summaries are critical)
- Frequency without position could mislead
- Structure signals intentional emphasis

### 4. Multi-Level Categorization

**Three-tier system**:
1. **Category**: Language, Tool, Skill, etc.
2. **Domain**: Technical, Business, Interpersonal, etc.
3. **Role**: Engineering, Product, Marketing, etc.

**Design rationale**:
- Different levels serve different purposes
- Category for basic grouping
- Domain for cross-role patterns
- Role for job-specific filtering

### 5. Transferability Logic

**Rules**:
- Soft skills are transferable
- Methodologies are transferable
- Interpersonal domain is transferable
- Technical skills are role-specific

**Design rationale**:
- Helps identify portable skills
- Useful for career transitions
- Distinguishes universal from specialized

## Usage Examples

### Basic Term Extraction

```python
from src.term_extractor import extract_terms_from_text

text = """
Senior Software Engineer with 5 years of Python development experience.
Led teams using Agile methodology and AWS cloud infrastructure.
Strong leadership and communication skills.
"""

terms = extract_terms_from_text(text)

# Access extracted terms
print(f"Found {len(terms)} unique terms")
for term_key, term in terms.items():
    print(f"{term.text}: category={term.category.value}, confidence={term.confidence:.2f}")
```

### Term Extraction with Context Analysis

```python
from src.term_extractor import extract_terms_from_text
from src.context_analyzer import analyze_term_contexts

text = """
Led Python development teams, improving performance by 50%.
Architected AWS infrastructure serving 1M+ users.
"""

# Extract terms
terms = extract_terms_from_text(text)

# Analyze contexts
contexts = analyze_term_contexts(terms, text)

# Find terms with strong verbs
python_ctx = contexts['python']
strongest_verb = python_ctx.get_strongest_verb()
print(f"Python used with verb: {strongest_verb[0]} (strength: {strongest_verb[1].value})")

# Find terms with quantifiable impact
for term_key, ctx in contexts.items():
    if ctx.has_quantifiable_impact():
        print(f"{ctx.term.text}: quantifiers = {ctx.quantifiers}")
```

### Full Pipeline with Categorization

```python
from src.term_extractor import extract_terms_from_text
from src.context_analyzer import analyze_term_contexts
from src.term_categorizer import categorize_terms

text = """
Senior Software Engineer with expertise in Python, Java, and AWS.
Led development of machine learning models, improving accuracy by 30%.
Strong leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills.
"""

# Step 1: Extract terms
terms = extract_terms_from_text(text)

# Step 2: Analyze contexts
contexts = analyze_term_contexts(terms, text)

# Step 3: Categorize
categorized = categorize_terms(terms, contexts)

# Filter by domain
from src.term_categorizer import SkillDomain, RoleCategory, TermCategorizer

categorizer = TermCategorizer()
categorizer.categorized_terms = categorized

technical_skills = categorizer.get_by_domain(SkillDomain.TECHNICAL)
print(f"\nTechnical skills: {[t.term.text for t in technical_skills]}")

# Filter by role
engineering_skills = categorizer.get_by_role(RoleCategory.ENGINEERING)
data_science_skills = categorizer.get_by_role(RoleCategory.DATA_SCIENCE)

# Get transferable skills
transferable = categorizer.get_transferable_skills()
print(f"\nTransferable skills: {[t.term.text for t in transferable]}")

# Generate report
report = categorizer.generate_taxonomy_report()
print(f"\nTotal terms: {report['total_terms']}")
print(f"By domain: {report['by_domain']}")
print(f"By role: {report['by_role']}")
```

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### Term Extraction
- âœ… Empty content → returns empty dict
- âœ… Unicode content → full support
- âœ… Very long documents → efficient pattern matching
- âœ… Special characters (C++, Node.js) → handled correctly
- âœ… Case insensitivity → normalized matching
- âœ… Word boundaries → prevents partial matches

### Context Analysis
- âœ… Terms without positions → prominence = 0
- âœ… Empty contexts → graceful degradation
- âœ… Multiple verb strengths → strongest selected
- âœ… Unicode in context → supported
- âœ… Very long context windows → truncated efficiently

### Term Categorization
- âœ… Unknown terms → UNKNOWN domain
- âœ… Terms without context → level inference skipped
- âœ… Empty term sets → empty results with valid stats
- âœ… Multi-role terms → all roles captured
- âœ… Industry-specific edge cases → pattern matching

---

## Known Limitations

### Term Extraction
1. **Predefined vocabulary**: Only recognizes terms in skill databases
   - **Mitigation**: Large database covering 100+ common skills
   - **Future**: Add ML-based extraction for unknown terms

2. **Context-free extraction**: Initial extraction doesn't use sentence structure
   - **Mitigation**: Context analysis in Phase 3.2 adds structure
   - **Future**: Could add dependency parsing

3. **Acronym ambiguity**: "PM" could be Project Manager or Product Manager
   - **Mitigation**: Context analysis helps disambiguate
   - **Future**: Add explicit disambiguation rules

### Context Analysis
1. **Verb-term association**: Assumes verbs in context window relate to term
   - **Mitigation**: Limited to 150-character windows
   - **Future**: Add sentence boundary detection

2. **Quantifier attribution**: May associate unrelated numbers with terms
   - **Mitigation**: Conservative pattern matching
   - **Future**: Add semantic relationship checking

### Term Categorization
1. **Single primary domain**: Terms assigned to one domain
   - **Mitigation**: Role categories allow multiple assignments
   - **Future**: Support multiple domains per term

2. **Skill level inference**: Requires rich context
   - **Mitigation**: Falls back to None when uncertain
   - **Future**: Add more sophisticated inference rules

---

## Integration Points

text = text_extractor.extract_text(filepath)
document_type = document_processor.classify_document(text)

# Phase 3 extraction
terms = extract_terms_from_text(text, document_type)

# Cache results
cache_entry.terms = terms
cache_entry.term_count = len(terms)
```
