# Socratic Career Skills System Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Create 5 Claude Code skills that enable Socratic-guided job application development using pre-generated career lexicons.

**Architecture:** Pure LLM approach - skills read lexicon markdown files and use Socratic dialogue to guide users through job description analysis, resume tailoring, gap analysis, and cover letter development. No Python execution during application process (only for initial lexicon generation).

**Tech Stack:**
- Claude Code skills (markdown)
- Lexicon files (markdown, already generated by run_llm_analysis.py)
- Git for version control

# Job Description Analysis

## Overview

Analyze job postings to identify requirements, extract ATS keywords, decode organizational culture, and surface values alignment opportunities. Output is structured to enable direct comparison with your career lexicons.

**Core principle:** Interpretive analysis that goes beyond literal reading - decode culture, identify priorities, read omissions, and structure findings for gap analysis.

**Announce at start:** "I'm analyzing this job description to identify requirements, culture signals, and strategic opportunities."

## When to Use

**Standalone:**
- "Analyze this job description"
- "Help me understand this job posting"
- "What are the key requirements for this role?"

**As prerequisite for:**
- Resume alignment (need job analysis first)
- Job fit analysis (need job analysis first)
- Cover letter development (need job analysis first)

## Lexicon Integration

**Reads:** NONE (standalone analysis of job posting only)

**Outputs structure matching:**
- Section I → Compare with `01_career_philosophy.md`
- Section II → Compare with `02_achievement_library.md`
- Section III → Compare with `03_narrative_patterns.md`
- Section IV → Compare with `04_language_bank.md`

## Configuration

**Default paths (user can override):**
```python
APPLICATIONS_DIR = "~/career-applications/"
OUTPUT_FILE_PATTERN = "{date}-{job-slug}/01-job-analysis.md"
```

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Setup

**Actions:**
- Accept job posting (paste, upload, or URL)
- Create job slug from title (lowercase, hyphens, max 50 chars)
- Initialize output directory

**Example:**
```
Input: "Senior Director, Center for the Arts - UCLA"
Slug: "senior-director-arts-ucla"
Directory: ~/career-applications/2025-10-31-senior-director-arts-ucla/
```

### Phase 1: Document Intake

**Accept formats:**
- Pasted text
- Uploaded PDF/Word document
- URL (extract with WebFetch tool)

**Validation:**
- Minimum 100 words (if less, ask: "Is this the complete posting?")
- Extract full text successfully
- Confirm with user: "I have the job description. Ready to analyze?"

### Phase 2: Structured Analysis (4 Sections)

**Generate analysis matching lexicon structure:**

#### Section I: Values & Philosophy Requirements

**Extract:**
- Leadership expectations (stated + implied)
- Core values signals (explicit statements + language patterns)
- Problem-solving philosophy (data-driven? collaborative? innovative?)
- Decision-making approach indicators

**Output format:**
```markdown
## I. Values & Philosophy Requirements

### Leadership Expectations
[What leadership style/approach do they signal?]
**Evidence:** "[Quote from posting]"

### Core Values Signals
**Explicit:** [Values they state directly]
**Implicit:** [Values evident from emphasis/language]
**Evidence:** "[Quotes supporting interpretation]"

### Problem-Solving Philosophy
[How do they approach challenges? What evidence?]
```

**Purpose:** Enables comparison with `01_career_philosophy.md`

#### Section II: Experience & Achievement Requirements

**Extract and categorize by achievement types:**
- Capital Projects & Infrastructure
- Organizational Transformation
- Revenue Generation & Growth
- Academic Leadership
- Team Building & Management
- Technical/Specialized Skills

**For each category, identify:**
- Required experience (explicit must-haves)
- Preferred experience (nice-to-haves)
- Quantifiable expectations (budget sizes, team sizes, scope)
- Scale indicators (project complexity, stakeholder range)

**Output format:**
```markdown
## II. Experience & Achievement Requirements

### Capital Projects & Infrastructure
**Required:** [Explicit requirements with quotes]
**Preferred:** [Nice-to-have elements]
**Quantifiable Expectations:**
- Budget range: $X-Y mentioned
- Team size: N+ people
- Project duration: [if specified]

**Evidence:** "[Quotes from posting]"

### [Continue for each relevant category...]
```

**Purpose:** Enables comparison with `02_achievement_library.md`

#### Section III: Communication & Narrative Requirements

**Extract:**
- What storytelling approaches will resonate?
- Tone & voice requirements (formal? collaborative? innovative?)
- Cultural communication style
- Narrative patterns they use in posting

**Output format:**
```markdown
## III. Communication & Narrative Requirements

### Resonant Narratives
**Challenge-Solution Stories:** [Evidence they value this]
**Transformation Arcs:** [Evidence they value this]
**Collaboration Narratives:** [Evidence they value this]

### Tone & Voice Requirements
**Formality:** [Formal / Professional-Collaborative / Casual]
**Innovation:** [Traditional / Balanced / Cutting-Edge]
**Collaboration:** [Independent / Balanced / Highly Collaborative]

**Evidence:** "[Quotes demonstrating tone]"

### Cultural Communication Style
[How they talk about work, people, mission]
```

**Purpose:** Enables comparison with `03_narrative_patterns.md`

#### Section IV: Language & Terminology Requirements

**Extract and rank:**
- ATS keywords by importance (frequency + positioning + context)
- Action verbs they use (frequency analysis)
- Industry-specific terminology
- Power phrases and signature language
- Synonym mapping opportunities

**Output format:**
```markdown
## IV. Language & Terminology Requirements

### Critical ATS Keywords (Use in BOTH resume + cover letter)
1. **stakeholder management** (appears 5x, explicit requirement)
   - Context: "manage relationships with campus stakeholders"
   - Recommended frequency: 2-3x in materials
   - Placement: Resume (summary + 2 bullets), Cover letter (paragraph 2)

### Important Keywords (Emphasize in resume)
[Ranked by priority with context]

### Action Verbs They Use
**Strategic Leadership:** stewarded, cultivated, advanced (3x each)
**Operational:** managed, implemented, coordinated
**Collaborative:** partnered, engaged, facilitated

### Industry-Specific Language
[Terminology specific to sector/role]

### Synonym Mapping
- "stakeholder management" → "partner engagement", "relationship building"
- [Additional mappings]
```

**Purpose:** Enables comparison with `04_language_bank.md`

### Phase 3: Sophistication Analysis

**Go beyond literal requirements:**

#### Cultural Decoding

**Analyze:**
- Stated culture vs. implied culture (language patterns reveal reality)
- Contradictions (e.g., "innovative" + "established processes")
- What company emphasizes vs. what role actually requires

**Output:**
```markdown
## V. Sophistication Analysis

### Cultural Reality Check
**Stated:** "[What they say about culture]"
**Implied:** "[What language patterns reveal]"
**Interpretation:** [What daily work likely involves]
**Evidence:** "[Specific language choices]"
```

#### Reading What's NOT Said

**Identify meaningful omissions:**
- No team size → possible new team or restructuring
- No salary range → negotiation strategy or budget uncertainty
- No reporting structure → organizational flux
- No diversity statement → cultural blind spot
- Vague requirements → role still being defined

#### Competitive Positioning

**Analyze:**
- Who will win this role? (ideal candidate archetype)
- What differentiates strong vs. weak candidates?
- What trade-offs might they make? (e.g., experience vs. culture fit)

#### Priority Decoding

**Determine true vs. stated importance:**
- Analyze by: repetition, positioning, specificity, emphasis words
- Distinguish must-haves from boilerplate
- Rank requirements by "true importance"

**Method:**
```
High Priority Indicators:
- Mentioned 3+ times in different contexts
- Appears in first paragraph or summary
- Has specific quantifiable requirements
- Uses emphatic language ("critical", "essential")

Low Priority Indicators:
- Mentioned once at end of list
- Vague language ("familiarity with", "some experience")
- No specifics or examples
```

#### Risk & Red Flag Assessment

**Identify concerns with severity and context:**

```markdown
### Risk Assessment

⚠️ MODERATE: "Fast-paced environment" + "manage multiple priorities"
- **Context:** Also mentions "work-life balance" support
- **Interpretation:** Likely typical workload, not crisis mode
- **Severity:** Monitor during interview
- **Matters if:** You value clear boundaries and predictable hours

🚩 HIGH: No mention of team size + "build from scratch"
- **Context:** New role, unclear resources
- **Interpretation:** Possible under-resourcing or ambiguous scope
- **Severity:** Clarify expectations before accepting
- **Matters if:** You need clear structure and adequate support

✅ POSITIVE: Strong DEI commitment with specific initiatives
- **Context:** Multiple references, budget allocated
- **Interpretation:** Authentic commitment, not performative
- **Opportunity:** Align with your equity-centered values
```

#### Strategic Timing Analysis

**Assess:**
- New role vs. backfill (affects expectations and flexibility)
- Urgency signals ("immediate start", "fast-growing team")
- Organizational stability indicators
- How quickly to apply

### Phase 4: Output Generation

**Write to:** `~/career-applications/[job-slug]/01-job-analysis.md`

## Startup Checks

**If no job description provided:**
"I need a job description to analyze. You can:
- Paste the text directly
- Upload a PDF or Word document
- Provide a URL to the posting"

**If posting too short (<100 words):**
"This seems incomplete (only [N] words). Is this the full posting?"

**If multiple postings detected:**
"I see content that looks like multiple job descriptions. Which one should I analyze?"

**If extraction fails:**
"I couldn't extract text from that file. Can you try:
- Copy/pasting the text
- Saving as PDF first
- Providing the URL instead"
```

# ATS Keyword Framework

## Overview

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) screen resumes by keyword matching before human review. Understanding how they work enables strategic keyword usage that passes screening without "stuffing."

## How ATS Systems Work

### Parsing & Extraction
1. ATS extracts text from resume (PDF, Word, plain text)
2. Identifies sections (experience, education, skills)
3. Extracts keywords and phrases
4. Scores against job description requirements

### Scoring Logic
**Keyword presence:** Does keyword appear? (binary yes/no)
**Keyword frequency:** How many times? (2-3x ideal, 1x weak, 5+ suspicious)
**Context matching:** Is keyword used in proper context?
**Section placement:** Where does it appear? (summary > experience > skills)

**Common scoring:**
- Exact match: 100% (e.g., "stakeholder management")
- Synonym match: 70-80% (e.g., "partner engagement" for "stakeholder management")
- Related term: 40-60% (e.g., "relationship building" for "stakeholder management")
- No match: 0%

## Keyword Density Best Practices

### The 2-3x Rule
**Optimal:** 2-3 mentions of critical keywords
- 1x = Weak signal (might be coincidence)
- 2-3x = Strong signal (demonstrates pattern)
- 4+x = Suspicious (possible keyword stuffing)

**Exception:** Common industry terms can appear more frequently naturally

### Strategic Placement Pattern

**Priority order (ATS weighting):**
1. **Professional Summary** (highest weight) - 1x critical keywords
2. **Recent Experience** (high weight) - 2x in different contexts
3. **Skills Section** (medium weight) - 1x for technical terms
4. **Earlier Experience** (lower weight) - contextual usage

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD:
Summary: "Senior leader with expertise in stakeholder management..."
Experience (recent): "Managed stakeholder relationships across 5 campuses..."
Experience (recent): "Facilitated stakeholder alignment for $10M project..."
Skills: "Stakeholder Engagement, Partner Relations"

❌ STUFFING:
Summary: "Stakeholder management expert with stakeholder management experience in stakeholder management contexts..."
```

## Context Matching

### Keywords Need Context

**ATS scans for context clues around keywords:**

✅ **Strong context:**
"Stewarded $12M capital project from conception through delivery"
- Keyword: "capital project"
- Context: budget size, scope, role
- ATS score: HIGH

⚠️ **Weak context:**
"Familiar with capital projects"
- Keyword: "capital project"
- Context: vague, no specifics
- ATS score: LOW

❌ **No context:**
"Skills: Capital Projects, Budgeting, Management"
- Keyword: present but isolated
- Context: none (just list)
- ATS score: MINIMAL

### Context Enhancement Techniques

**Add quantification:**
- Not: "Managed projects"
- Yes: "Managed 5 projects totaling $20M"

**Add outcomes:**
- Not: "Led stakeholder engagement"
- Yes: "Led stakeholder engagement resulting in 95% approval"

**Add scope:**
- Not: "Budget oversight"
- Yes: "Budget oversight for $15M capital program across 3 facilities"

## Synonym Strategies

### Why Synonyms Matter

**Job descriptions use varied language:**
- "Stakeholder management" OR "partner engagement" OR "relationship building"
- ATS may score all as related but weight exact match higher

**Strategy:** Use exact match 2-3x, use synonyms for additional context

### Common Synonym Patterns

**Leadership:**
- Led = Stewarded, Directed, Oversaw, Guided, Managed
- Built = Developed, Created, Established, Launched, Founded

**Collaboration:**
- Stakeholder management = Partner engagement, Relationship building, Collaboration
- Cross-functional = Interdisciplinary, Multi-departmental, Integrated

**Financial:**
- Budget management = Fiscal oversight, Financial stewardship, Resource allocation
- Revenue growth = Income generation, Financial development, Earned revenue

### Synonym Usage Pattern

```
✅ STRATEGIC:
- "Stewarded $12M capital project..." (exact match: stewarded)
- "Led cross-functional team..." (synonym: led)
- "Directed budget planning..." (synonym: directed)

❌ MISSED OPPORTUNITY:
- "Managed project..." (generic)
- "Managed team..." (generic)
- "Managed budget..." (repetitive, no keyword variation)
```

## Industry-Specific Keyword Patterns

### Higher Education / Academic
**Common keywords:**
- Student success, enrollment, retention, recruitment
- Curriculum development, pedagogy, assessment
- Accreditation, program review, learning outcomes
- EDIAB, inclusive excellence, access, equity
- Faculty relations, shared governance

**ATS tip:** Use both academic ("pedagogy") and accessible ("teaching methods") versions

### Nonprofit / Arts
**Common keywords:**
- Mission-driven, community impact, stakeholder engagement
- Fundraising, development, donor relations, grant writing
- Board relations, governance, strategic planning
- Program evaluation, outcome measurement
- Community partnerships, public service

### Corporate / Business
**Common keywords:**
- P&L management, ROI, KPIs, metrics
- Strategic planning, business development, market analysis
- Change management, process improvement, operational excellence
- Cross-functional leadership, matrix management

## Common ATS Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Keyword Stuffing
**Problem:** Repetitive, unnatural keyword usage
**Detection:** ATS flags 5+ uses of same keyword, unusual keyword density
**Fix:** Use 2-3x rule, incorporate synonyms

### 2. Graphics & Tables
**Problem:** ATS can't read text in images or complex tables
**Detection:** ATS extracts empty strings or garbled text
**Fix:** Use plain text, simple formatting, avoid images with text

### 3. Uncommon Section Headers
**Problem:** ATS can't identify sections (e.g., "My Journey" instead of "Experience")
**Detection:** ATS misclassifies content, misses keywords in wrong section
**Fix:** Use standard headers (Experience, Education, Skills, Summary)

### 4. PDFs with Accessibility Issues
**Problem:** Some PDFs not machine-readable (scanned images, locked files)
**Detection:** ATS extracts no text
**Fix:** Ensure PDF is text-based (test by copying text from PDF)

### 5. Acronyms Without Spelled-Out Version
**Problem:** ATS might not match "PM" to "project management"
**Detection:** Missed keyword matches
**Fix:** First use: "Project Management (PM)", subsequent: "PM" alone

### 6. Skills Section Only
**Problem:** Keywords only in skills list, no context in experience
**Detection:** Low context score despite keyword presence
**Fix:** Use keywords in experience bullets, not just skills section

## Strategic Keyword Workflow

**From job description analysis:**

1. **Extract critical keywords** (required skills, repeated 3+x)
2. **Identify exact phrases** used in posting
3. **Map to resume experiences** (where can these naturally appear?)
4. **Calculate current frequency** (how many times already present?)
5. **Plan additions** (where to add 1-2 more mentions with context)
6. **Verify context** (each usage has quantification/scope/outcome)
7. **Check density** (2-3x for critical, 1-2x for important)
8. **Test readability** (does it still sound natural?)

## Example: Keyword Optimization

**Job description keyword:** "Stakeholder Management" (appears 5x in posting)

**Current resume:**
```
✗ No mentions of "stakeholder"
✗ Generic "managed relationships" (1x, vague)
```

**Optimized resume:**
```
Summary:
"Senior arts administrator with expertise in stakeholder management..."

Experience (Recent Position):
"Stewarded $12M capital project, managing stakeholder relationships across
city government, donor community, and campus leadership, achieving 100%
on-time regulatory approvals"

Experience (Earlier Position):
"Facilitated stakeholder alignment for strategic planning process, engaging
200+ faculty, staff, and students through listening sessions and data-driven
recommendations"

Skills:
"Stakeholder Engagement • Partner Relations • Community Building"
```

**Result:**
- Exact match "stakeholder management": 1x (summary)
- Keyword "stakeholder": 4x total (natural contexts)
- Synonyms: "partner relations" (skills), "engagement" (multiple)
- Context: budgets, scope, outcomes provided
- Density: Appropriate (not stuffing)

---

**Remember:** ATS optimization is about strategic clarity, not gaming. If you genuinely have the experience, keywords should fit naturally with proper context.

# Tone Analysis Guide

## Overview

Job posting language reveals organizational culture and expectations beyond literal requirements. Learning to decode tone helps match your application voice to their culture and assess cultural fit.

## Tone Classification Taxonomy

### Formality Spectrum

**Highly Formal** ← → **Professional-Collaborative** ← → **Casual**

#### Highly Formal (Traditional/Corporate)
**Indicators:**
- Passive voice ("will be responsible for")
- Lengthy sentences with subclauses
- Bureaucratic language ("pursuant to", "aforementioned")
- Third-person references ("the candidate will")
- No contractions, no casual language

**Example:**
"The successful candidate will be responsible for the oversight and administration
of institutional advancement initiatives, pursuant to strategic objectives as
determined by the Vice President for Development."

**Culture signals:** Hierarchical, process-oriented, traditional

**Application strategy:** Match formality in cover letter, emphasize structure and process

---

#### Professional-Collaborative (Modern/Balanced)
**Indicators:**
- Active voice ("you will lead")
- Clear, direct sentences
- Mix of formal and accessible language
- "You" and "we" pronouns
- Some energy, not stiff

**Example:**
"You'll lead our institutional advancement strategy, partnering with the VP of
Development to build donor relationships and grow our annual giving program."

**Culture signals:** Balanced, team-oriented, professional but approachable

**Application strategy:** Warm but professional tone, emphasize collaboration

---

#### Casual (Startup/Creative)

- Minimal team mentions
- "Work independently"

**Example:**
"Manage your portfolio of 50 major gift prospects independently, with quarterly
check-ins with the Director."

**Culture:** Values individual initiative, minimal oversight, clear ownership

---

#### Balanced
**Indicators:**
- Both independent work AND collaboration mentioned
- "Collaborative environment" without excessive emphasis

| "Occasional evening/weekend" | Realistic expectation | Honest (better than hidden) |
| "Must be available evenings" | Expect regular overtime | Red flag if no comp time |

### Growth/Development Culture

| Phrase | Interpretation | Culture Signal |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| "Professional development budget" | Invests in growth | Supportive, retention-focused |
| "Mentorship opportunities" | Values learning | Developmental culture |
| "Pathways to advancement" | Clear progression | Well-structured organization |
| "Wear many hats" | Ambiguous role | Possible under-resourcing |
| "Opportunity to learn" | Vague support | Possibly understaffed, "learning" = figuring it out alone |

## Writing Style Matching Guide

### How to Mirror Formality Level

**If posting is Formal:**
- Use complete sentences, no contractions
- Professional vocabulary (utilize vs. use, commence vs. start)
- Structured paragraphs
- Third-person or restrained first-person

**If posting is Professional-Collaborative:**
- Clear, direct language
- Active voice
- Strategic use of "I" and "we"
- Balance professionalism with warmth

**If posting is Casual:**
- Conversational tone
- Contractions okay
- Show personality
- Shorter sentences

### Vocabulary Alignment Techniques

**Extract their key verbs and mirror them:**

Job posting uses: "stewarded", "cultivated", "advanced"
Your cover letter: Use same verbs (if authentic to your experience)

**Adopt their terminology:**

Job posting: "stakeholder engagement"
Your materials: Use "stakeholder engagement" (not "relationship management")

Job posting: "evidence-based decision-making"
Your materials: "evidence-based" (not just "data-driven")

### Sentence Structure Matching

**Analyze their sentence patterns:**

**Short, punchy (tech/startup):**
"We're growing fast. You'll lead our expansion. Impact is immediate."
→ Your cover letter: Similar short sentences, energy

**Longer, thoughtful (academic/nonprofit):**
"This role offers the opportunity to contribute to our mission of advancing
equitable access to transformative artistic experiences while building
sustainable community partnerships that honor our institutional values."
→ Your cover letter: Similar sentence length, thoughtful flow

**Balanced (most professional settings):**
Mix of sentence lengths, clear but not choppy

## Red Flags in Tone Analysis

### Contradictory Signals

**"Innovative" + "Risk-averse"**
- Signal: Confused culture or divergent leadership
- Interpretation: Possible tension between stated values and reality
- Strategy: Ask about innovation examples in interview

**"Collaborative" + "Fast-paced startup"**
- Signal: Potentially unrealistic expectations
- Interpretation: Want consensus but don't have time for it
- Strategy: Clarify decision-making process

**"Work-life balance" + "Fast-paced, high-pressure"**
- Signal: Possible performative balance claim
- Interpretation: Marketing vs. reality gap
- Strategy: Ask current staff about actual work hours

### Excessive Hype Language

**Too many exclamation points:**
"Join our amazing team! Make an impact! Love what you do!"
- Signal: Possibly compensating for weak offer (low pay, unclear role)
- Interpretation: Emphasis on passion may mean below-market compensation

**Unrealistic Superman requirements:**
"10+ years experience, entry-level enthusiasm, executive vision, willing to start immediately, work evenings/weekends, master of 15 tools"
- Signal: Unclear role definition or wishful thinking
- Interpretation: Possible under-resourcing or unrealistic expectations

### Missing Standard Components

**No mention of supervision/reporting:**
- Signal: Unclear organizational structure
- Interpretation: Role possibly still being defined, or ambiguous authority

**No team size mentioned:**
- Signal: Possible new team or restructuring
- Interpretation: Ask about team structure and growth plans

**Vague about responsibilities:**
"Various duties as assigned", "Opportunity to contribute to multiple projects"
- Signal: Scope creep potential
- Interpretation: Role boundaries unclear, possible overwork

---

## Recognizing Implicit Values

### Reading Between the Lines

**What they emphasize = what they value**

Job posting emphasizes:
- Budget management (5 mentions) → Values fiscal responsibility
- Stakeholder relationships (7 mentions) → Values collaboration/partnership
- Data collection (3 mentions) → Values evidence-based practice
- Regulatory compliance (2 mentions) → Values risk management

**What they omit = possible gap**

No mention of:
- Innovation → May value stability over change
- Diversity → May have blind spot (or assume it's obvious)
- Work-life balance → May expect long hours
- Professional development → May not prioritize growth

### Cultural Clues

**Formality level signals values:**
- Very formal → Values tradition, hierarchy, process
- Casual → Values adaptability, informality, speed
- Balanced → Values professionalism with accessibility

**Length and detail signal values:**
- Long, detailed requirements → Values precision, thoroughness
- Brief, high-level → Values autonomy, trust in hiring process
- Narrative style → Values storytelling, mission connection

---

## Connecting Personal Experience to Organizational Values

### The Evidence Bridge

**Formula:** Value + Evidence + Relevance

**Example:**

**Their value:** "Commitment to arts as a tool for social justice"

**Your connection:**
1. **Value:** "I share UCLA's commitment to arts as social justice"
2. **Evidence:** "I've led initiatives that center equity and access, including [specific example with outcomes]"
3. **Relevance:** "This directly aligns with UCLA's mission to [their specific goal]"

**Full sentence:**
"UCLA's commitment to arts as a tool for social justice resonates deeply with my 15-year practice of centering equity and access, exemplified by my leadership of the [specific initiative] which expanded participation by 40% among underserved communities."

### Mapping Exercise

**Step 1: Extract their values**
- List 3-5 values from posting (explicit + implicit)

**Step 2: Identify your alignments**
- Which values authentically match your experience?
- What specific evidence do you have?

**Step 3: Build bridges**
- Draft 1-2 sentence connections for each alignment
- Test: Does this feel authentic? Can I cite specific evidence?

---

## Authentic vs. Performative Alignment

### Authentic Alignment Characteristics

✅ **Specific evidence:** Cites concrete actions/outcomes
✅ **Sustained pattern:** Multiple examples over time
✅ **Trade-offs acknowledged:** Honest about challenges
✅ **Behavioral proof:** Actions speak louder than claims
✅ **Natural language:** Sounds like how you actually talk

**Example (Authentic):**
"Over the past decade, I've approached arts administration as a practice of equity-centered leadership. This meant difficult decisions: transitioning from a free-admission model despite board resistance to ensure long-term sustainability, implementing Spanish-language programming even when initial participation was low, and consistently allocating 15% of budget to access initiatives. These weren't easy choices, but they reflected my core belief that arts institutions must actively create equity, not just espouse it."

### Performative Alignment Characteristics

❌ **Vague claims:** No specific evidence
❌ **Buzzword heavy:** Uses trendy language without substance
❌ **No trade-offs:** Everything was easy/perfect
❌ **Generic statements:** Could apply to anyone
❌ **Feels forced:** Doesn't sound like natural voice

**Example (Performative):**
"I'm passionate about diversity, equity, and inclusion! I believe everyone should have access to the arts. I value creating inclusive environments where all voices are heard. I'm committed to social justice and transformative experiences for underserved communities."

**Problem:** No evidence, no specifics, just values claims. Anyone could write this.

---

## Cover Letter Integration Techniques

### Opening Hook Using Values

**Pattern:** [Their unique position] + [Shared value] + [Your evidence]

**Example:**
"UCLA's School of the Arts and Architecture is uniquely positioned by its intersection of artistic excellence, research innovation, and public mission to advance arts as a tool for social transformation—a vision that aligns precisely with my 15-year commitment to arts-as-social-justice practice, evidenced by [specific achievement]."

**Why it works:**
- Shows you understand their distinctiveness
- Names shared value authentically
- Provides immediate evidence (not just claim)

### Mid-Letter Alignment

**Pattern:** [Their stated priority] + [Your approach] + [Specific example]

**Example:**
"Your emphasis on community-engaged programming resonates with my approach to stakeholder partnership. At [Institution], I didn't just 'reach out' to community members—I restructured our planning process to center community voice, hosting 12 listening sessions that directly shaped our $5M facility renovation and resulted in 40% increase in neighborhood participation."

**Why it works:**
- Connects to their language ("community-engaged")
- Shows depth of commitment (restructured process, not just event)
- Quantifiable outcome
- Demonstrates understanding that real partnership = structural change

### Closing Reflection on Shared Mission

**Pattern:** [Synthesize alignment] + [Forward-looking vision] + [Invitation]

**Example:**
"The Senior Director role offers the opportunity to bring my infrastructure expertise and equity-centered practice to an institution uniquely positioned to model how artistic excellence and community impact advance together. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with UCLA's vision for arts as a transformative public good."

**Why it works:**
- Synthesizes key alignments (infrastructure + equity-centered)
- Uses their language ("transformative public good")
- Forward-looking (focused on contribution, not just fit)
- Invitational tone

---

## Examples of Effective Values-Based Excerpts

### Example 1: DEI Alignment

**Job posting value:** "Commitment to inclusive excellence and equitable access"

**Cover letter excerpt:**
"Throughout my tenure at [Institution], I've practiced equity-centered leadership not as an add-on initiative, but as foundational to every decision. When our board questioned the ROI of Spanish-language programming during its low-participation first year, I presented data showing 18-month adoption curves from similar programs and advocated for sustained investment. By year three, Latinx participation had grown 120%, and these community members now represent 30% of our donor base. This experience taught me that authentic equity work requires both conviction and evidence, patience and metrics—a balance I see reflected in UCLA's approach to inclusive excellence."

**Why effective:**
- Specific example (Spanish-language programming)
- Honest about challenges (board resistance, low initial participation)
- Quantifiable outcomes (120% growth, 30% of donor base)
- Connects learning to their approach
- Uses their language ("inclusive excellence")

---

### Example 2: Innovation + Tradition Balance

**Job posting value:** "Honor our 85-year legacy while exploring innovative approaches"

**Cover letter excerpt:**
"Like UCLA, I value the tension between tradition and innovation. At [Historic Institution], I stewarded our transition from free-admission to earned-revenue model—a significant shift for an 80-year-old organization. Rather than discarding our legacy of access, I designed a new scholarship program that actually expanded free attendance by 15% while growing earned revenue 20% year-over-year. This taught me that honoring tradition doesn't mean preserving every practice unchanged; it means preserving core values (access, excellence) while adapting methods to ensure sustainability."

**Why effective:**
- Acknowledges the value tension directly
- Specific transformation example
- Shows respect for tradition + pragmatic innovation
- Reframes innovation as preserving core values
- Demonstrates systems thinking

---

### Example 3: Mission-Driven + Financial Sustainability

**Job posting value:** "Advance our mission while ensuring fiscal sustainability"

**Cover letter excerpt:**
"I approach this mission/money tension as a both/and proposition, not either/or. When I inherited a beloved program operating at 60% cost recovery, I didn't cut it to balance the budget—I analyzed why audiences valued it, then repositioned it to attract a broader demographic while maintaining its core offering. Within two years, we achieved 95% cost recovery while growing participation 40%. This experience reinforced my belief that financial sustainability and mission integrity are mutually reinforcing when approached with strategic creativity and data-informed decision-making."

**Why effective:**
- Names the tension they care about
- Specific example with numbers
- Shows problem-solving approach (analyze, reposition, measure)
- Reframes sustainability and mission as compatible
- Demonstrates strategic thinking + values commitment

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Values Name-Dropping Without Evidence

❌ "I value innovation, collaboration, diversity, and excellence."

Why it fails: Generic, unverifiable, could be copy-pasted to any application

✅ "I've practiced equity-centered innovation by [specific example]"

Why it works: Specific, verifiable, demonstrates behavioral pattern

### 2. Exaggerating Alignment

❌ Claiming to be "passionate" about a value you discovered in the job posting

Why it fails: Rings false, easily detected in interviews

✅ Focus on genuine alignments; acknowledge where you're learning/growing in others

Why it works: Authentic, shows self-awareness, demonstrates growth mindset

### 3. Making It About You, Not Them

❌ "This role would help me grow my skills in [area]"

Why it fails: Centers your needs, not their mission

✅ "My experience in [area] positions me to contribute to [their specific goal]"

Why it works: Centers their needs, shows what you bring

### 4. Generic Mission Statements

❌ "I'm excited about your mission to make a difference."

Why it fails: Empty, could apply to any nonprofit/mission-driven org

✅ "Your specific focus on [unique aspect of their mission] aligns with my approach to [relevant experience]"

Why it works: Shows you understand what makes THEM distinctive

### 5. Over-Claiming

❌ "I've completely transformed organizational culture around DEI"

Why it fails: Grandiose, likely untrue, culture change is slow/complex

✅ "I've contributed to cultural shifts by implementing [specific practices], resulting in [measurable change]"

Why it works: Acknowledges complexity, shares credit, provides evidence

---

## Values Alignment Checklist

Before including values-based language in cover letter:

☐ Have I identified specific values from the posting (not assumed)?
☐ Do I have concrete evidence of this value in my experience?
☐ Can I cite specific actions/outcomes (not just beliefs)?
☐ Does this sound like my authentic voice (not buzzwords)?
☐ Have I connected MY experience to THEIR specific context?
☐ Am I being honest about challenges/trade-offs?
☐ Would I feel comfortable discussing this in depth in an interview?

**If you can't check all boxes, reconsider including that values claim.**

---

**Remember:** Authentic values alignment isn't about claiming to be perfect—it's about demonstrating you've grappled with the same challenges they face and developed approaches that align with their philosophy.

# Resume Alignment

## Overview

Tailor your resume to specific job descriptions by matching verified achievements from your career lexicon to job requirements. Every statement is traceable to source—no fabrication, no exaggeration.

**Core principle:** Authentic alignment through verified evidence. All content must trace to lexicon sources or user-provided documents.

**Announce at start:** "I'm tailoring your resume using your achievement library to ensure authentic, verified alignment with this job."

## When to Use

- "Tailor my resume for this job"
- "Align my resume with this position"
- "Update my resume for [job title]"

## Lexicon Dependencies

**Required files:**
- ✅ `~/career-applications/[job-slug]/01-job-analysis.md` (what they need)
- ✅ `~/lexicons_llm/02_achievement_library.md` (what you have)
- ✅ `~/lexicons_llm/04_language_bank.md` (how to phrase it)

**Missing prerequisites:**
- If no job analysis: "I need a job analysis first. Should I analyze the job description now?"
- If no lexicons: "I need your career lexicons. Run: python run_llm_analysis.py"

## Configuration

**Default paths:**
```python
LEXICONS_DIR = "~/lexicons_llm/"
APPLICATIONS_DIR = "~/career-applications/"
OUTPUT_FILE_PATTERN = "{job-slug}/02-resume-tailored.md"
```

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Lexicon Loading

**Startup sequence:**

1. Check for job analysis file
```
ls ~/career-applications/*/01-job-analysis.md | sort -r | head -1
```

If found: "I found your analysis of [job title]. Use this?"
If not found: "No job analysis found. Options:
1. Analyze job description now
2. Specify path to existing analysis
3. Cancel"

2. Load lexicons
```
Read: ~/lexicons_llm/02_achievement_library.md → store in context
Read: ~/lexicons_llm/04_language_bank.md → store in context
```

If files not found: Error with instructions to run lexicon generator

3. Verify all files loaded successfully

**Confirmation:**
"Loaded successfully:
- Job analysis: [job title]
- Achievement library: [count] achievements across [categories]
- Language bank: [count] action verbs

Ready to match your achievements to job requirements."

### Phase 1: Job + Lexicon Review

**Display job analysis summary:**
```markdown
Job: [Title] at [Company]

Top Requirements (from analysis):
1. [Requirement 1] - Priority: HIGH
2. [Requirement 2] - Priority: HIGH
3. [Requirement 3] - Priority: MEDIUM

Relevant sections of your achievement library:
- Section II.A: Capital Projects (3 achievements)
- Section III.A: Revenue Generation (2 achievements)
- Section IV: Academic Leadership (4 achievements)
```

**Ask:** "Ready to select specific achievements for each requirement?"

### Phase 2: Match & Select

**For each high-priority job requirement:**

Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to present side-by-side comparison:

```markdown
## Requirement: "Project management experience with $5M+ budgets"

From your Achievement Library (Section II.A: Capital Projects):

**Option A: Kirk Douglas Theater - $12.1M Project**

Variation 1 (Project Management Focus):
"Stewarded $12.1M adaptive reuse project from conceptual sketch through
on-time, on-budget delivery, managing all phases including budgeting,
architect selection, regulatory approvals, construction oversight, and
operational launch"

Source: achievement_library.md:338-342
Best for: PM roles, operations positions, executive leadership
Highlights: Process management, timeline adherence, comprehensive scope

Variation 2 (Financial Stewardship Focus):
"Delivered on-time, on-budget completion of $12.1M capital project,
negotiating Disposition and Development Agreement with municipality and
managing complex public-private partnership financing"

Source: achievement_library.md:348-352
Best for: CFO/finance roles, budget-conscious positions, fiscal leadership
Highlights: Fiscal responsibility, budget management, financial structuring

**Option B: Outdoor Amphitheater - 600-seat venue**

Variation 1 (Scope Focus):
"Conceived and delivered 600-seat outdoor amphitheater from design through
completion, managing vendor relationships and regulatory compliance"

Source: achievement_library.md:405-408

Highlights: End-to-end ownership, stakeholder coordination

Which achievement and variation best demonstrates your qualifications
for this requirement?

Options:
- Kirk Douglas (Variation 1 - Project Management)
- Kirk Douglas (Variation 2 - Financial Stewardship)
- Outdoor Amphitheater (Variation 1)
- None - I'll describe a different project
```

**Selection tracking:**
```python
selections = {
    "requirement_1": {
        "achievement": "Kirk Douglas Theater",
        "variation": "Project Management Focus",
        "source": "achievement_library.md:338-342",
        "text": "[full text]"
    }
}
```

**Language selection from language bank:**

```markdown
The job posting uses "stewarded" 3 times. Your language bank categorizes
this under:
- Section I.A.1: Vision & Planning (Strategic Leadership)
- Usage context: Opening statements, executive-level positioning
- Frequency in your materials: Used in 60% of executive role applications

Use "stewarded" for your capital project bullets? [Yes/No]

Alternative verbs from your language bank:
- "Led" (more common, less distinctive)
- "Oversaw" (similar authority level)
- "Directed" (slightly more authoritative)
```

**Build selection list for all requirements**

### Phase 3: Draft Creation

**Generate resume section by section**

For each section (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills):

**Present before/after comparison:**

```markdown
## Professional Experience

### Associate Producer | Center Theatre Group | 1997-2004

**Original (from your 2023 resume):**
"Led theater renovation project with team of contractors"

**Proposed (tailored for this role):**
"Stewarded $12.1M adaptive reuse project from conception through on-time,
on-budget delivery, managing cross-functional team of 50 full- and part-time
staff across design, construction, and operational launch phases"

**Source:** achievement_library.md:338 (Kirk Douglas Theater, Variation A: Project Management Focus)

**Keywords matched:**
- "stewarded" (job posting priority keyword)
- "$12.1M" (exceeds $5M+ requirement)
- "cross-functional team" (collaboration emphasis from posting)
- "on-time, on-budget" (fiscal responsibility signal)

**Does this accurately represent your experience?**
- Yes → Include as written
- No → Tell me what's inaccurate
- Adjust → What changes would make this authentic?
```

**Rules:**
- ONLY include after user confirms "Yes"
- If "No" → Ask "What's inaccurate?" → Revise → Re-present
- If "Adjust" → Socratic questioning → Refine → Re-present
- Track every confirmation with timestamp

**Evidence tracking:**

```python
evidence_trail = {
    "line_5": {
        "content": "Stewarded $12.1M adaptive reuse project...",
        "sources": [
            "achievement_library.md:338 (Kirk Douglas, Variation A)",
            "language_bank.md:192 (Strategic Leadership verbs)"
        ],
        "keywords_matched": ["stewarded", "$12.1M", "cross-functional"],
        "user_confirmed": "2025-10-31",
        "accurate": True
    }
}
```

**Continue for all resume sections**

### Phase 4: Authenticity Validation

**Present complete draft:**

```markdown
# [Your Name]

[Complete tailored resume with all sections]

---

## Evidence & Source Trail

**Line 5:** "Stewarded $12.1M adaptive reuse project..."
← achievement_library.md:338 (Kirk Douglas Theater, Variation A)
← language_bank.md:192 (Strategic Leadership: Vision & Planning)

**Line 8:** "Negotiated multi-party agreement..."
← achievement_library.md:358 (Kirk Douglas Theater, Variation C)
← language_bank.md:215 (Stakeholder Engagement: Collaborative)

[... continue for all bullets ...]

---

## Verification Checklist

☐ All achievements verified from lexicon
☐ All language from language bank or user's existing materials
☐ No fabrication or exaggeration
☐ User confirms authenticity
☐ ATS keywords from job analysis incorporated
```

**Final authenticity check:**

Ask: "Does this resume feel authentic to how you describe your work?"

**Wait for explicit confirmation before saving**

**If user has concerns:**
- "What feels inauthentic?" → Address specific concern
- Review that section against lexicon sources
- Revise or remove questionable content
- Re-confirm

**Only save after:** "Yes, this feels authentic"

### Phase 5: Output Generation

**Write to:** `~/career-applications/[job-slug]/02-resume-tailored.md`

**File template:**

```markdown

## Verification Status

✅ No fabricated content
✅ All achievements traced to lexicon or user-provided documents
✅ User confirmed authenticity: YYYY-MM-DD
✅ ATS keywords from job analysis incorporated
✅ Every statement includes source citation
✅ Before/after comparison approved for all changes

---
Generated: YYYY-MM-DD via resume-alignment skill
Version: 1.0
```

**Present to user:**

```
Resume tailored and saved to:
~/career-applications/[job-slug]/02-resume-tailored.md

Summary:
- [N] achievements from your library
- [N] keywords from job analysis incorporated
- [N] action verbs matched to their language
- 100% verified (no fabricated content)

Next steps:
1. Review the tailored resume
2. Export to Word/PDF for submission
3. Proceed to job fit analysis (identify gaps + plan cover letter)
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Lexicons

```markdown
**If achievement_library.md not found:**

"I can't find your achievement library at ~/lexicons_llm/02_achievement_library.md

To generate your lexicons:
1. cd /path/to/career-lexicon-builder
2. python run_llm_analysis.py

This analyzes your career documents and creates the lexicons I need
to tailor your resume authentically.

Should I wait while you generate them?"
```

### Missing Job Analysis

```markdown
**If no job analysis found:**

"I need a job analysis to know what requirements to match.

Options:
1. Analyze the job description now (I'll invoke job-description-analysis skill)
2. You already have an analysis - specify the path
3. Cancel and run job analysis separately

Which would you prefer?"
```

### No Matching Achievements

```markdown
**If no lexicon achievements match a requirement:**

"I couldn't find achievements in your library that match:
'[Requirement from job]'

This suggests either:
1. You have this experience but it's not in your lexicons (add documents + regenerate)
2. This is a genuine gap (we'll address in job-fit-analysis skill)
3. The requirement can be reframed using different experiences

What would you like to do:
- Skip this requirement for now
- Describe an unlisted experience (I won't add it without verification)
- Proceed with gaps documented for cover letter reframing
```

### User Rejects Proposed Text

```markdown
**If user says "No, that's not accurate":**

"What's inaccurate about this description?"

[Listen to response]

"Let me revise based on what you've shared:

[Revised text]

Source: [same or adjusted source]

Is this more accurate?"

**If still not accurate after 2 revisions:**

"This achievement may not be the right match for this requirement.

Options:
1. Choose a different achievement from your library
2. Skip this requirement
3. We can address this as a gap in the job-fit-analysis phase

Which would you prefer?"
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Every achievement traces to lexicon (source citations included)
✅ Every language choice references language bank or user's existing materials
✅ ATS keywords from job analysis incorporated appropriately
✅ User confirms: "This resume is authentic to my experience"
✅ No fabricated content (verified through evidence trail)
✅ Resume demonstrates competitive fit for the role
✅ All before/after comparisons approved by user

## Testing Validation

**Before claiming skill is complete:**

1. Test with real job + user's lexicons
2. Verify lexicon loading works
3. Confirm side-by-side achievement presentation
4. Check evidence trail includes all sources
5. Validate user cannot skip authentication without explicit confirmation
6. Ensure no hallucinated achievements
7. Confirm output file saved correctly with metadata

Socratic-guided job application development using pre-generated career lexicons.

## Overview

5 Claude Code skills that guide you through job description analysis, resume tailoring, gap analysis, and cover letter development using your personal career lexicons.

## Prerequisites

**You must first generate your career lexicons:**

```bash
cd /path/to/career-lexicon-builder
python run_llm_analysis.py
```

This creates 4 lexicon files in `~/lexicons_llm/`:
- `01_career_philosophy.md` - Your values and leadership approach
- `02_achievement_library.md` - Your achievements with variations
- `03_narrative_patterns.md` - Your storytelling patterns
- `04_language_bank.md` - Your authentic language

## Skills

### 1. Job Description Analysis
**Invoke:** "Analyze this job description"
**Output:** Structured analysis matching your lexicon categories
**Use when:** Starting a new job application

### 2. Resume Alignment
**Invoke:** "Tailor my resume for this job"
**Requires:** Job analysis + your lexicons
**Output:** Tailored resume with source citations
**Use when:** Need customized resume for specific role

### 3. Job Fit Analysis
**Invoke:** "Analyze my fit for this role"
**Requires:** Job analysis + your lexicons
**Output:** Gap analysis + cover letter plan
**Use when:** Want to understand strengths/gaps and plan positioning

### 4. Cover Letter Voice Development
**Invoke:** "Develop my cover letter narrative"
**Requires:** Job analysis + your lexicons
**Output:** Narrative framework + tone profile
**Use when:** Need to find authentic voice for letter

### 5. Collaborative Writing
**Invoke:** "Help me write [anything]"
**Requires:** Your lexicons (optional)
**Output:** Co-created draft
**Use when:** Any professional writing task

## File Organization

```
~/career-applications/
└── YYYY-MM-DD-[job-slug]/
    ├── 01-job-analysis.md
    ├── 02-resume-tailored.md
    ├── 03-gap-analysis-and-cover-letter-plan.md
    ├── 04-cover-letter-framework.md
    └── 05-cover-letter-draft.md (optional)
```

## Workflow Example

```
1. "Analyze this job description" [paste JD]
   → Creates 01-job-analysis.md

2. "Tailor my resume for this role" [upload current resume]
   → Creates 02-resume-tailored.md (all verified from lexicons)

3. "Analyze my fit for this role"
   → Creates 03-gap-analysis-and-cover-letter-plan.md

4. "Develop my cover letter narrative"
   → Creates 04-cover-letter-framework.md

5. "Help me draft the cover letter"
   → Creates 05-cover-letter-draft.md
```

## Key Principles

**Lexicon-Grounded:** All content verified against your lexicons
**No Fabrication:** Every statement traceable to source
**Socratic Process:** One question at a time, user confirmation required
**Evidence-Based:** All outputs include source citations
**Modular:** Use skills independently or in sequence

## Updating Lexicons

When you have new career documents:

```bash
cd /path/to/career-lexicon-builder
# Add new documents to my_documents/
python run_llm_analysis.py
```

Skills automatically use updated lexicons on next invocation.

## Task 9: Documentation & Deployment

**Step 1: Update main repo README**

Modify: `/Users/anthonybyrnes/PycharmProjects/career-lexicon-builder/README.md`

Add section after "Quick Start":

```markdown
## Socratic Career Application Skills

After generating your lexicons, use the Socratic career skills for job applications:

**Skills installed in:** `~/.claude/skills/career/`

### Quick Workflow

1. **Analyze job description**
   ```
   "Analyze this job description" [paste/upload JD]
   ```

2. **Tailor resume**
   ```
   "Tailor my resume for this role" [upload resume]
   ```

3. **Plan cover letter**
   ```
   "Analyze my fit and plan my cover letter"
   ```

4. **Draft materials**
   ```
   "Develop my cover letter narrative"
   "Help me draft the cover letter"
   ```

**See:** `~/.claude/skills/career/README.md` for detailed skill documentation

**Principles:**
- All content verified against your lexicons
- No fabrication - every statement traceable
- Socratic dialogue guides process
- Evidence trails in all outputs
```

**Step 2: Create migration guide**

Create: `MIGRATING_TO_SKILLS.md`

```markdown
# Migrating from Socratic Steps to Skills

The Socratic career application process has been implemented as Claude Code skills.

## What Changed

**Before:** Markdown documentation in `Socratic Steps/`
**Now:** Executable skills in `~/.claude/skills/career/`

## Installation

Skills are already installed if you see them in:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/career/
```

Should show:
- job-description-analysis/
- resume-alignment/
- job-fit-analysis/
- cover-letter-voice/
- collaborative-writing/

## Usage

**Invoke by natural language:**

Instead of: "Let's use the Socratic Resume Alignment process"
Now: "Tailor my resume for this job"

Skills activate automatically based on your request.

## Preserved Files

Original documentation preserved in `Socratic Steps/` for reference.

## Benefits of Skills

- ✅ Automatic lexicon loading
- ✅ Built-in verification (no fabrication)
- ✅ Evidence trails in outputs
- ✅ File organization handled automatically
- ✅ Resumable (can pause and continue)
- ✅ Integrated with career lexicons

## Support

See skill-specific README: `~/.claude/skills/career/README.md`
```

**Step 3: Commit documentation**

```bash
git add README.md MIGRATING_TO_SKILLS.md
git commit -m "docs: add Socratic skills documentation

Updated main README with skills workflow.
Created migration guide from Socratic Steps markdown to skills.

Users can now invoke skills via natural language to:
- Analyze job descriptions
- Tailor resumes
- Analyze fit and plan cover letters
- Develop cover letter voice
- Collaborate on writing

All skills integrate with LLM-generated lexicons."
```

---

## Task 10: Merge to Main

**Use:** @superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch

**Step 1: Verify all work committed**

```bash
cd .worktrees/socratic-career-skills
git status
```

Expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

**Step 2: Verify tests pass (if applicable)**

```bash
# No automated tests for skills (manual validation in Task 8)
echo "Manual validation complete per TEST_RESULTS.md"
```

**Step 3: Invoke finishing skill**

"I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

**Step 4: Follow skill guidance**

Expected options:
1. Create PR
2. Merge directly (if solo project)
3. Clean up without merging

**Step 5: Clean up worktree after merge**

```bash
# After merge complete:
cd /Users/anthonybyrnes/PycharmProjects/career-lexicon-builder
git worktree remove .worktrees/socratic-career-skills
```

---

## Success Criteria

**All tasks complete when:**

✅ 5 skills installed in `~/.claude/skills/career/`
✅ Each skill has SKILL.md with complete workflow
✅ Job description analysis has 3 reference documents
✅ All skills tested individually
✅ End-to-end integration test passed
✅ Documentation updated (README, migration guide)
✅ Test results documented
✅ Feature branch merged to main
✅ Worktree cleaned up

**Quality checks:**

✅ Skills follow design document specifications
✅ Lexicon loading works correctly
✅ No fabrication possible (evidence requirements enforced)
✅ Socratic process maintained (one question at a time)
✅ Output files include metadata and evidence trails
✅ User authentication required at key points
✅ Error handling graceful (missing files, invalid input)

---

## Notes for Engineer

**Skills are markdown files:** The SKILL.md files contain the full workflow specification. Claude Code reads and executes these specifications.

**Testing is manual:** Since these are conversational skills, automated testing isn't applicable. Manual validation with real job descriptions is required.

**Lexicon dependency:** All skills except job-description-analysis require pre-generated lexicons. User must run `python run_llm_analysis.py` first.

**External installation:** Skills install to `~/.claude/skills/career/`, outside the git repo. Document this clearly in commits.

**Socratic = slow:** The deliberate one-question-at-a-time process is intentional. Resist temptation to batch questions or skip confirmations.

**Evidence > efficiency:** Every output must include complete source citations. This trades speed for trustworthiness.
