## Implementation Details

### Metadata
- **name:** job-fit-analysis
- **description:** Analyze fit between job requirements and background using lexicons - identifies gaps, develops reframing strategies, creates cover letter plan

### Workflow Phases

#### Phase 0: Lexicon Loading
- Reads job analysis from `~/career-applications/[job-slug]/01-job-analysis.md`
- Reads career philosophy from `~/lexicons_llm/01_career_philosophy.md`
- Reads achievement library from `~/lexicons_llm/02_achievement_library.md`
- **Key principle:** Trusts job analysis output, doesn't re-parse job description

#### Phase 1: Load & Review
- Displays job analysis summary
- Reviews relevant lexicon sections
- Identifies potentially matching categories
- Confirms understanding with user

#### Phase 2: Gap Analysis (Direct Comparison)
- Compares job requirements against lexicon achievements
- Uses ✅/⚠️/❌ symbols for match assessment
- Provides detailed assessment for each requirement category
- Ranks by job priority from job analysis
- Creates summary matrix of strengths, partial matches, and gaps

#### Phase 3: Reframing Strategy Development
- For each gap or partial match, presents reframing options
- Uses AskUserQuestion tool for user selection
- Grounds all strategies in actual lexicon achievements
- Documents chosen approach with sources
- Builds reframing list for cover letter integration

#### Phase 4: Cover Letter Plan Development
- Creates detailed opening strategy (values alignment)
- Develops middle paragraphs (achievements + reframing)
- Plans closing strategy (forward-looking invitation)
- Defines tone profile matching job + user voice
- Provides integration guidance with resume

### Key Features
