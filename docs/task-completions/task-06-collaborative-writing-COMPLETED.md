## Files Created

### Primary Skill File
- **Location:** `~/.claude/skills/career/collaborative-writing/SKILL.md`
- **Size:** 689 lines, 21 KB
- **Purpose:** General-purpose collaborative writing skill with optional lexicon integration

## Implementation Details

### Skill Structure

1. **YAML Frontmatter**
   - name: collaborative-writing
   - description: Co-create any professional writing through Socratic dialogue using established voice patterns

2. **Overview Section**
   - Core principle from original Socratic skill preserved
   - "Announce at start" message included
   - Purpose statement combining both sources

3. **Phase 0: Lexicon Loading (Conditional)** [NEW]
   - Determines writing context (job-related vs. general professional)
   - Attempts to load lexicons (narrative_patterns.md, language_bank.md, optional job-analysis.md)
   - Clear status messaging: reports whether lexicons loaded or not
   - Graceful degradation: proceeds confidently with or without lexicons
   - Key principle: "Lexicons are helpful but NOT required"

4. **Phase 1: Discovery Dialogue** (from original skill)
   - Goal: Establish shared clarity on purpose, audience, context
   - Method: Ask one question at a time
   - Sections: Strategic Intent, Target Audience, Emotional/Tonal Objectives, Constraints
   - Output: Intent Statement
   - Transition cue: "Shall we move from discovery into message shaping?"

5. **Phase 2: Message Architecture** (from original skill)
   - Goal: Identify and organize core ideas
   - Sections: Essential Ideas, Supporting Details, Narrative Arc
   - Output: Message Map
   - Transition cue: "Would you like me to suggest how these points could be expressed or ordered?"

6. **Phase 3: Framing and Voice Calibration** (enhanced)
   - Goal: Define emotional texture, voice, stylistic stance
   - Method: Explore through contrast and testing
   - **Sections:**
     - 3A. Voice Exploration Through Contrast
     - 3B. Emotional Register and Stylistic Stance
     - 3C. Language Choices and Authenticity
     - 3D. Lexicon-Enhanced Voice Calibration (IF lexicons loaded)
   - **Enhancement:** When lexicons available, provides detailed analysis:
     - Narrative patterns (opening strategies, evidence presentation, rhythm)
     - Language bank (preferred verbs, power phrases, terminology)
     - Recommended voice synthesis (audience needs + authentic patterns)
   - **Without lexicons:** Voice profile based purely on dialogue
   - Output: Voice Profile
   - Transition cue: "Ready for me to propose a short passage or sample paragraph in this voice?"

7. **Phase 4: Collaborative Drafting** (enhanced)
   - Goal: Move from reflection to writing
   - Method: Co-create in 50-150 word segments
   - **Sections:**
     - 4A. Drafting Approach
     - 4B. Sequential Drafting with Voice Consistency
     - 4C. Mid-Draft Check-In
     - 4D. Complete the Draft
   - **Enhancement:** After each segment, if lexicons loaded:
     - Voice Consistency Check against language bank
     - Verify action verbs match user's patterns
     - Check phrasing patterns alignment
     - Confirm rhythm matches natural flow
   - Iterative feedback incorporation
   - Output: Refined Draft
   - Transition cue: "Would you like me to compile this into a polished version for final review?"

8. **Phase 5: Alignment and Adaptation** (from original skill)
   - Goal: Validate resonance and adaptability
   - **Sections:**
     - 5A. Intent Alignment Check
     - 5B. Resonance Testing
     - 5C. Adaptability Exploration (platform, length, audience variations)
     - 5D. Final Refinements
     - 5E. File Output
   - Output: Finalized Message Framework and Draft
   - Saved to user-specified location

9. **When to Revisit Earlier Phases**
   - Conditions for returning to Discovery, Architecture, or Voice Calibration
   - "Returning to earlier dialogue is not regression — it's refinement"

10. **Success Criteria**
    - Voice authenticity (with or without lexicons)
    - Strategic clarity (intent achieved)
    - Structural integrity (message flows)
    - Tonal consistency (voice maintained)
    - User confidence (ready to send/publish)

11. **Working With and Without Lexicons**
    - Clear explanation of both scenarios
    - When available: "amplifying your authentic voice"
    - When not available: "discovering your authentic voice together"
    - Both approaches produce high-quality writing

## Key Design Features

### What Makes This Skill Different from Tasks 2-5

1. **Lexicons are OPTIONAL, not required**
   - No hard stops if lexicons missing
   - Graceful degradation with clear messaging
   - Works excellently with or without lexicons

2. **General-Purpose Application**
   - Not limited to job applications
   - Supports any professional writing
   - Adaptable to diverse contexts

3. **Based on Proven Process**
   - Original Socratic-Collaborative-Writing-Skill.md preserved
   - 5-phase structure maintained
   - Transition cues retained
   - Voice and methodology honored

4. **Lexicon Integration Enhances, Doesn't Replace**
   - Phase 0: Optional loading with clear status
   - Phase 3: Enhanced calibration when available
   - Phase 4: Consistency checks when possible
   - Core Socratic process works independently

### Quality Standards Maintained

From approved Tasks 2-5:
- ✅ Clear phase structure with numbered sections
- ✅ Comprehensive examples throughout
- ✅ User confirmation at key transition points
- ✅ Evidence trails (when lexicons available)
- ✅ Professional tone without emojis
- ✅ Detailed success criteria
- ✅ Related skills references

Unique to this skill:
- ✅ Dual-mode operation (with/without lexicons)
- ✅ Clear status messaging about lexicon availability
- ✅ Graceful degradation patterns
- ✅ Original Socratic methodology preserved
- ✅ Flexible, general-purpose design

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Read design document (lines 1317-1413)
2. ✅ Read original Socratic-Collaborative-Writing-Skill.md
