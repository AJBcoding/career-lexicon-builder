Dear Search Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Associate Professor of Theatre position at Northwestern University. With over fifteen years of experience in theatrical production and academic leadership, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your distinguished theatre program.

# Why Northwestern University?

Northwestern's commitment to innovative theatrical practice aligns perfectly with my artistic vision. Your recent production of *Hamlet* at the Wirtz Center demonstrated the kind of bold, experimental work that has defined my career. I am particularly drawn to your emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement.

# Professional Experience

Throughout my tenure at University of California, Berkeley, I have directed over twenty major productions, including *Death of a Salesman* at the Aurora Theatre Company and *Angels in America* at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre. In my role as Associate Professor, I have mentored dozens of students who have gone on to successful careers in professional theatre.

My directing work has been recognized with awards from the Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle, and my production of *The Crucible* was featured at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival.

# Teaching Philosophy

I believe in creating inclusive learning environments where students can take artistic risks and develop their unique voices. My courses in Advanced Directing and Contemporary Performance Practice have consistently received outstanding evaluations, with students praising my ability to balance rigorous technical training with creative exploration.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in theatrical direction, production design, and academic leadership could contribute to Northwestern's theatre program. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Dr. Sarah Martinez
Associate Professor of Theatre
