Dear Members of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television Search
Committee,

 

I am writing to express my interest in the Associate Dean and Chief
Administrative Officer position at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and
Television. I understand UCLA prioritizes internal UC candidates, and I
respect that preference. However, as Interim Associate Dean for
California State University, Long Beach's College of the Arts, I offer
peer-institution perspective with directly transferable California
public higher education expertise. Dean Shimizu's belief in the
transformative power of not only our art forms but of our institutions,
resonates deeply with my own convictions and sense of purpose. Dean
Shimizu and Chancellor Frenk\'s direct articulation of what is at stake
for the arts and higher education in this moment, while championing our
underlying values and promise, inspires me to apply for this position.

 

Our moment is filled with fear and uncertainty---for our students, whose
very identities may be under threat; for our colleagues facing tectonic
shifts exacerbated by political tensions; and for our fields at an
inflection point driven by technology, culture, and economics. Against
this backdrop, sound, consistent, innovative leadership and stewardship
is not merely a requirement. It is a necessity ... and an opportunity.
Often from the greatest turbulence comes the greatest growth. This
opportunity---and my belief that I can serve it---represent an
opportunity worth transitioning from a faculty administrative position
at California State University Long Beach's (CSULB) to a staff
administrative position at UCLA.

 

For the past three years, as Interim Associate Dean at CSULB College of
the Arts, I have helped guide operations of significant scale and
complexity: a \$29 million budget serving 4,300 students across 23
academic programs with over 400 faculty and staff. At the core of my
work has been a student-centered commitment that prioritizes inclusive
excellence and equity for students, faculty, and staff alike. Over the
past 2 years, I have had the privilege of co-chairing the creation and
implementation of a new strategic plan, the college's first in 15 years.
Alongside my fellow Associate Dean, I've engaged a broad range of
internal and external stakeholders to create a road map for the college
moving forward. I am proud that this strategic plan document is the
product of a \'bottom up\' iterative process that recognized buy-in for
the plan was as important as the plan itself.

This approach and philosophy---one that centers inclusive
collaboration--- is born of a career of relationship-building that has
spanned government, campus, community, donors, and professional arts
networks. I understand the critical interdependence of communication and
storytelling, development and operations, and financial leadership, and
know how to integrate these functions effectively. At CSULB, this
approach has allowed me to work within a state university's structure
and process to support student needs and artistic culture, both of which
rarely fit neatly within conventional bureaucratic boundaries. By
working creatively within existing systems and constraints, I
significantly expanded our student advising infrastructure, securing
funding for five new positions that reduced our highest caseload from
665 to 389 students, a 41% improvement, while implementing systems that
enhance both operational efficiency and human outcomes. Recognizing the
limitations of existing financial reporting structures, I **built a new
data architecture** that synthesizes previously disconnected information
to more effectively analyze, communicate, and project the college\'s
instructional budget. This innovation has transformed our College's
budget conversations with Academic Affairs, providing the data
foundation for advocating more realistic---and increased---funding while
ensuring that faculty, staff, and administrators work from shared
understanding.  While serving as chair of our Theatre Arts Department, I
partnered with the California Center for Equality and Justice to
implement comprehensive cultural transformation using restorative
justice processes, achieving 100% hiring of adjunct faculty of color
during my tenure while establishing transparent systems that empower
both students and faculty. All this work has been in support of the
dean's vision and in alignment with institutional priorities.

 

At the Shakespeare Center of Los Angeles, I inherited a nonprofit
organization in crisis: an annual deficit of \$273,000 (19.6% of
operating expenses) and non-compliance issues stemming from poor
bookkeeping practices and significant audit notes. I brought the
organization into full compliance with appropriate financial and
management controls while fundamentally transforming the organization's
revenue model. Through strategic work grounded in robust analysis of
institutional history and data that had previously been neglected, I
delivered a \$414,000 financial turnaround (29.6% of annual operating
budget) within one year---generating the organization\'s first surplus
on record (\$141,000, representing 10.1% of expenses). I grew the
organization's signature gala 370% from \$117,000 (8.4% of expenses) to
\$552,000 (39.5% of annual operating budget), established \$122,000 in
earned income streams (8.9% of expenses) from ticket sales and education
programs, and diversified the revenue model to reduce contribution
dependency from 97% to 54%. Over two years, I generated \$303,000 in
cumulative surpluses (22% of average annual expenses) while reducing
operating costs 9%, rebuilding organizational net assets 62.5% and
establishing a sustainable financial trajectory after years of deficits.

Earlier in my career at Center Theatre Group, I stewarded the \$18
million adaptive re-use of the Kirk Douglas Theatre from conceptual
sketch through on-time, on-budget delivery---a seven-year project cycle
with stakeholders across public, private, community, and philanthropic
partners. The project transformed a 1947 movie theater into a 317-seat
theater, catalyzing downtown Culver City\'s cultural and economic
renaissance. I

negotiated the Disposition and Development Agreement with Culver City
and coordinated between architects and consultants, managing all stages
of development including architect selection, design development, and
construction coordination. In parallel, I designed comprehensive
operational and HR models and budget structures, creating sustainable
systems for production, front-of-house, technical, and administrative
staff (all within a larger organization with its own unique culture and
policies). As part of the team building and professional development, we
used the creation of the Ivy Substation as a precursor and proving
ground to develop the ethos and skills necessary to welcome the city to
a new venue and expand Center Theatre Group's reach across the city.

 

While I recognize I would need to build knowledge of UC-specific
policies and internal controls were I to join TFT in this role, I am no
stranger to the vagaries of multi-fund budgeting. My deep experience
navigating CSU policies and California public higher education provides
a strong transferable foundation. My track record of quickly mastering
complex institutional frameworks---including creating an integrated
curriculum database spanning four university data systems and co-leading
comprehensive strategic planning engaging 8 academic and public arts
units across a college of the arts---demonstrates that I possess the
learning agility and systems-thinking essential for becoming fluent in
the UC system. I\'m prepared to invest significant time in transition to
ensure seamless Dean support and operations oversight.

What I do bring is a deep context for the cultural ecosystem in which
the School of Theatre, Film and Television exists. Throughout my career,
I have navigated creative, academic, and administrative realms---one
foot in the rehearsal room or classroom, the other in the board room.
This dual perspective has sharpened my capacity to serve as a bridge and
translator across multiple constituencies. I am equally comfortable
speaking with a student, a stagehand, a donor, a university
administrator, or a faculty member---with a deep appreciation for how
the work of one affects the others. This foundational respect for a
diversity of perspectives and voices has made me a trusted advisor and
strategic partner in all my work in service of organizational vision and
mission.

Which brings me to the oft-overlooked idea that we should love where we
work. All of us--- students, staff, artists, faculty,
administrators---entered academia because we are passionate about what
we do. I believe it\'s essential that we find joy in our work and the
people with whom we have the privilege to collaborate. While no chief
administrative officer can remove all obstacles or solve every
challenge, they can set a tone for the culture of place and an
appreciation for everyone who works, creates, and learns there. I bring
to my work a sense of playful joy and gratitude for the opportunity to
do what I love.

The Associate Dean and Chief Administrative Officer role offers the
opportunity to bring my strategic partnership experience, financial and
operational expertise, capital project leadership, and deep commitment
to arts-as-social-transformation to an institution uniquely positioned
to shape the next generation of humanistic storytellers. I understand
the value UCLA places on UC system experience, and I'm prepared to
address questions about transitioning from the CSU to UC environment.
I'm confident my ability to build relationships across campus and with
external stakeholders, combined with my authentic alignment with TFT's
mission, would enable me to contribute meaningfully to Dean Shimizu's
leadership team. I would welcome the opportunity to speak further about
how my experience might serve UCLA TFT's continued excellence.
