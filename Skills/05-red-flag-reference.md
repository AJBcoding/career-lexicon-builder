# Red Flag Reference Guide

## Overview

This reference provides a comprehensive framework for identifying potential concerns in job postings and assessing their severity. Use this guide to detect warning signs, apply reasonableness tests, and provide applicants with informed guidance about potential issues.

**Core principle:** Red flags don't automatically disqualify opportunities, but they warrant careful consideration and informed decision-making. The goal is protection through awareness, not paranoia—helping applicants recognize concerning patterns while respecting their autonomy to accept calculated risks.

## Red Flag Categories

### Category 1: Scope and Expectation Red Flags

These signals suggest the role may be poorly defined, understaffed, or have unrealistic expectations.

#### High-Severity Scope Red Flags

**"Wearing Many Hats" (without clear definition)**

Signal: "You'll wear many hats," "Jack of all trades," "We need someone who can do it all"

Problem: Often indicates:
- Understaffing or poor resource allocation
- Lack of role clarity
- Expectation to perform multiple full-time jobs
- Impossible to succeed due to scattered focus

Assessment questions:
- Are specific hats identified, or is it vague?
- Does seniority level match the breadth of responsibilities?
- Is this an early-stage startup where versatility is truly needed, or an established org that should have specialized roles?

**Unrealistic Scope for Seniority Level**

Signal: Entry-level title with senior-level responsibilities, or vice versa

Examples:
- "Junior Analyst" expected to "drive strategic initiatives across the organization"
- "Senior Director" with no direct reports or budget authority

Problem:
- Suggests disconnect between role design and organizational reality
- May indicate they want senior performance at junior compensation
- Could reflect poor understanding of role requirements

**Vague or Missing Success Criteria**

Signal: No clear description of what success looks like, only lists activities

Problem:
- How will performance be evaluated?
- What are the actual priorities?
- Suggests unclear expectations or moving goalposts

#### Medium-Severity Scope Red Flags

**"As Needed" Scope Creep**

Signal: "And other duties as assigned," "As needed," "And more"

Context matters:
- Reasonable in small orgs or startups (everyone pitches in)
- Concerning in large established orgs (suggests poor boundaries)

**Hybrid Roles Without Clear Priority**

Signal: Two distinct functions combined (e.g., "Marketing Manager and Executive Assistant")

Problem:
- Which function is actually primary?
- When responsibilities conflict, what takes priority?
- May indicate two part-time needs presented as one full-time role

Assessment: Ask user which function matters more to them, and whether split focus is acceptable

**Project-Based Role Described as Ongoing**

Signal: Responsibilities sound like a 6-month project, not an ongoing position

Problem:
- What happens when the project ends?
- Job security concerns
- May be better suited as contract work

### Category 2: Compensation Red Flags

These signals suggest potential below-market pay, hidden costs, or compensation structure concerns.

#### High-Severity Compensation Red Flags

**No Salary Range Provided (in locations requiring transparency)**

Signal: Salary omitted entirely

Context:
- Increasingly required by law in many jurisdictions
- When legally required but missing: compliance concern
- When not required but typical in industry: potential low-ball strategy

Problem:
- Wastes applicant time if compensation is non-competitive
- May indicate unwillingness to pay market rate
- Could suggest they adjust offers based on desperation

**"Competitive Salary" Without Range**

Signal: "Competitive salary," "Commensurate with experience," "Salary DOE"

Problem:
- "Competitive" is subjective and often means "lower end of market"
- Provides no actual information
- May indicate below-market compensation they're reluctant to state

**Commission-Heavy or "Unlimited Earning Potential"**

Signal: "Unlimited earning potential," "Sky's the limit," Heavy commission structure

Context matters:
- Legitimate in some sales roles
- Red flag when base salary is far below market

Problem:
- Often indicates low or no base salary
- Income instability
- May be pyramid scheme or exploitative structure

**"Equity in Lieu of Salary"**

Signal: Below-market salary offset by equity, especially in later-stage companies

Problem:
- Equity value highly uncertain
- Often overvalued by company
- May never materialize
- Legitimate in very early startups with limited runway, concerning otherwise

#### Medium-Severity Compensation Red Flags

**Benefits Not Mentioned**

Signal: No mention of health insurance, retirement, PTO, or other standard benefits

Problem:
- May indicate benefits are poor or nonexistent
- Total compensation lower than appears
- Suggests company doesn't invest in employee well-being

Assessment: Is this a contract role where benefits aren't expected, or full-time where they should be?

**Long Probationary Period**

Signal: 6+ month probationary period, or probationary period with reduced pay/benefits

Problem:
- Extended evaluation suggests high turnover or indecisiveness
- Working with reduced benefits for extended period
- Easy termination without cause

**"Salary Based on Location"**

Signal: For remote roles, salary varies by candidate location

Context:
- Increasingly common practice
- Can be legitimate cost-of-living adjustment
- Can also be exploitation (paying less for same work)

Assessment: Are they transparent about the calculation, or is it arbitrary?

### Category 3: Culture Red Flags

These signals suggest potentially toxic work environment, poor boundaries, or unsustainable expectations.

#### High-Severity Culture Red Flags

**"Fast-Paced" + Long Hours Signals**

Signal: "Fast-paced environment" combined with "nights and weekends," "whatever it takes," "startup hours"

Problem:
- Code for chronic overwork
- Poor work-life boundaries
- Burnout culture
- Unsustainable pace

Assessment: Is this temporary (crunch period) or perpetual?

**"Thick Skin" or "Not for Everyone"**

Signal: "Thick skin required," "Not for the faint of heart," "We work hard, play hard," "High-pressure environment"

Problem:
- Often code for abrasive management or toxic culture
- Normalizes aggressive communication
- Suggests psychological safety issues
- "We work hard, play hard" often means mandatory socializing + overwork

**"Family" or "We're Like a Family"**

Signal: "We're like a family here," "Family atmosphere"

Problem:
- Often used to justify:
  - Boundary violations (families don't have boundaries)
  - Below-market compensation (families sacrifice for each other)
  - Unprofessional dynamics
  - Guilt-based retention
- Legitimate families don't need to announce they're families

**High Turnover Signals**

Signal: Multiple similar roles posted repeatedly, "Backfilling" language, "Rapidly growing team" (for established company)

Problem:
- Suggests people leave quickly
- May indicate systemic issues
- High learning curve with no institutional knowledge
- Red flag if same role posted every 6 months

#### Medium-Severity Culture Red Flags

**"Always On" Expectations**

Signal: "Respond to emails promptly," "Available as needed," "Must be flexible with hours"

- Suggests poor boundaries
- May mean 24/7 availability
- Work-life balance concerns

Context: Reasonable for on-call roles (IT, medicine), concerning for most positions

**Excessive Enthusiasm Requirements**

Signal: "Passionate," "Enthusiastic," "Love what you do," "Bring energy every day"

Problem:
- Emotional labor expectations
- Suggests compensation/conditions aren't sufficient motivation
- May indicate high-pressure culture where appearing excited is mandatory

Signal: Large, established company seeking "entrepreneurial" mindset

Problem:
- Often means:
  - Lack of resources
  - Unclear support
  - You're expected to figure it out alone

Context: Some mention is fine; excessive emphasis is concerning

**Typos, Grammatical Errors, Poor Formatting**

Signal: Multiple obvious errors, inconsistent formatting, sloppy presentation

Problem:
- Suggests carelessness or disorganization
- If external-facing posting is this messy, what's internal organization like?
- May indicate rushed hiring or high turnover

Context: One typo is human; many suggest systemic issues

### Category 5: Contradiction Red Flags

These signals suggest internal inconsistency, unclear priorities, or organizational confusion.

#### High-Severity Contradiction Red Flags

**Contradictory Requirements**

Signal: Mutually exclusive or conflicting requirements

Examples:
- "Strategic thinker who can execute tactical details" + "Focus exclusively on high-level vision"

## Reasonableness Checking Framework

Apply this framework to assess whether expectations are reasonable given role context.

### Question Set 1: Resource Alignment

**Does the role have resources to succeed?**

Check for:
- Adequate staffing (or acknowledgment of resource constraints)
- Budget authority if needed for role responsibilities
- Tools and systems mentioned
- Support structure described

Red flag: Extensive responsibilities with no mention of resources, budget, or support

### Question Set 2: Scope-Seniority Match

**Do responsibilities align with stated seniority level?**

Assessment:
- Junior roles → Clearly defined, supervised work
- Mid-level roles → Some autonomy, project ownership
- Senior roles → Strategic influence, leadership scope
- Executive roles → Organizational impact, budget/people management

Red flag: Junior title with executive scope, or vice versa

### Question Set 3: Time Reality Check

**Can stated responsibilities fit in a standard work week?**

Rough estimation:
- Count major responsibility categories
- Estimate hours for each
- Add up total

Red flag: 60+ hours of responsibilities for "standard 40-hour role"

### Question Set 4: Industry Norms

**Are expectations typical for this industry/role type?**

Context considerations:
- Consulting/finance: longer hours are industry norm
- Startups: more ambiguity and scope flexibility
- Government: more structure and process
- Academia: different rhythm (semester vs. summer)

Red flag: Expectations that exceed even aggressive industry norms

### Question Set 5: Compensation-Responsibility Ratio

**Does compensation level match responsibility level?**

Use market data:
- Check industry salary surveys
- Review similar roles on job boards
- Consider total compensation (base + benefits + equity)

Red flag: Responsibilities 2+ levels above typical for compensation offered

---

## Market Compensation Guidelines

### Using Salary Data

**Reliable sources:**
- Glassdoor, Levels.fyi (tech-focused)
- Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook
- Industry-specific salary surveys (e.g., Robert Half for accounting/finance)
- Professional association salary reports
- LinkedIn Salary Insights

**Assessment approach:**
1. Identify comparable role titles
2. Adjust for location (cost of living)
3. Adjust for organization size
4. Adjust for industry
5. Consider seniority level

### Compensation Red Flag Thresholds

**Severe underpayment:**
- 30%+ below market median for role/location
- No benefits where benefits are standard
- Commission-only where base salary is typical

**Moderate underpayment:**
- 15-30% below market median
- Below-average benefits package
- Long vesting period for equity

**Within reasonable range:**
- Within 15% of market median either direction
- Standard benefits package
- Transparent compensation structure

### Total Compensation Considerations

Look beyond base salary:

**Standard components:**
- Health insurance (+ quality of coverage)
- Retirement contributions (401k match, pension)
- Paid time off (vacation, sick, holidays)
- Professional development budget
- Remote work options (cost savings)

**Additional components:**
- Equity (realistically valued)
- Bonuses (structure and attainability)
- Relocation assistance
- Tuition reimbursement
- Wellness benefits

**Calculation:**
If base salary is 10% below market but benefits are strong, total compensation may be competitive.

## Red Flag Severity Scoring System

### Scoring Framework

Assign severity level to each detected red flag:

**Minor (1 point):**
- Common across industry
- Easily clarified in interview
- Workaround available
- Single instance of concerning language

**Moderate (3 points):**
- Industry-specific concern
- Requires careful evaluation
- May be dealbreaker for some
- Multiple instances of concerning pattern

**Severe (5 points):**
- Strong indicator of problematic environment
- Difficult to work around
- Likely dealbreaker for most
- Systemic issue suggested

### Aggregate Assessment

**Total score interpretation:**

**0-5 points:** Typical posting with minor concerns
- Present findings transparently
- Note areas to explore in interview
- No significant deterrents

**6-15 points:** Multiple concerns warranting careful consideration
- Highlight patterns clearly
- Recommend probing deeply in interview
- Suggest reflecting on risk tolerance
- May be acceptable with clear understanding

**16+ points:** Significant red flags suggesting high-risk opportunity
- Present findings clearly and seriously
- Recommend proceeding with caution
- Suggest considering whether risks are acceptable
- May want to explore other opportunities

### Scoring Examples

**Example 1: Startup Role**
- "Wearing many hats" (1 point - expected in startups)
- No salary range (3 points - should be transparent)
- "Fast-paced" (1 point - single mention, no long-hours language)
- Equity-heavy compensation (3 points - legitimate in early-stage but risky)
- **Total: 8 points** - Moderate concerns, typical startup risks

**Example 2: Established Company Role**
- "Wearing many hats" (3 points - concerning in established org)
- Vague buzzword-heavy description (5 points - can't assess fit)
- "Family atmosphere" (5 points - boundary concerns)
- Contradictory requirements (5 points - unclear expectations)
- Below-market salary (5 points - 25% under median)
- **Total: 23 points** - Severe concerns, high-risk opportunity

## User Protection Framework

### Presentation Guidelines

**Tone:** Informative, not alarmist
- Present findings objectively
- Acknowledge uncertainty (one posting doesn't tell full story)
- Respect user's autonomy to evaluate risks

**Structure:**
1. Note detected red flags by category
2. Provide severity assessment
3. Suggest clarifying questions for interview
4. Offer risk mitigation strategies
5. Remind user to trust their judgment

### Clarifying Questions to Suggest

Provide user with questions to ask during interview:

**For scope concerns:**
- "Can you walk me through a typical week in this role?"
- "How is success measured in this position?"
- "What resources and support does this role have?"

**For compensation concerns:**
- "Can you provide the salary range for this position?"
- "What does the total compensation package include?"
- "How does equity vest, and what's the current valuation?"

**For culture concerns:**
- "Can you describe the typical work schedule and flexibility?"
- "What's the team's approach to work-life balance?"
- "How long have team members been in their roles?"

**For expectation concerns:**
- "What are the top 3 priorities for this role in the first 6 months?"
- "Can you clarify how [contradictory requirement X] and [contradictory requirement Y] are balanced?"
- "Who has succeeded in this role and why?"

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

Suggest approaches to manage identified risks:

**For scope concerns:**
- Request detailed job description during interview
- Ask to speak with current team members
- Negotiate clear priorities in writing

**For compensation concerns:**
- Research market rates thoroughly
- Negotiate total package, not just base
- Get equity details in writing
- Consider contracting initially

**For culture concerns:**
- Request trial period or project-based start
- Speak with multiple team members
- Ask about turnover rates directly
- Trust your gut during interview

### When to Recommend Proceeding Cautiously

**Strong recommend caution when:**
- Multiple severe red flags (16+ severity points)
- User has alternatives with fewer concerns
- Red flags align with user's stated dealbreakers
- Pattern suggests systemic dysfunction

**Acknowledge legitimate risk-taking when:**
- User has specific reasons (career change, learning opportunity)
- User explicitly values something org offers (mission, equity upside)
- Risks are clearly understood and acceptable
- User has exit strategy if it doesn't work out

### Documentation Recommendations

Suggest user document red flags and responses:
- Keep notes from interview
- Get promises in writing (scope, compensation, schedule)
- Document expectations before accepting
- Use probationary period to validate environment

## Special Case: Legitimate vs. Illegitimate Red Flags

Not all red flag language is actually problematic. Context determines legitimacy.

### Legitimate Context Examples

**"Wearing many hats" is legitimate when:**
- Pre-product-market-fit startup (< 10 employees)
- Explicitly temporary (covering leave, building team)
- Compensated appropriately for breadth
- User seeks generalist experience

**"Fast-paced" is legitimate when:**
- Seasonal industry with predictable crunch periods
- Consulting with defined project cycles
- Explicitly balanced with rest periods
- Industry standard (emergency medicine, news)

**"Equity in lieu of salary" is legitimate when:**
- True early-stage startup with limited runway
- Founders taking similar risk
- Significant ownership stake (>1% for early employees)
- User explicitly seeking equity upside

### Illegitimate Context Examples

**"Wearing many hats" is a red flag when:**
- Established company (50+ employees) that should have specialized roles
- No acknowledgment of resource constraints
- Compensation doesn't reflect breadth

**"Fast-paced" is a red flag when:**
- Combined with "whatever it takes," "nights and weekends"
- No mention of flexibility or balance
- Described as perpetual state

**"Equity in lieu of salary" is a red flag when:**
- Later-stage company with funding
- Minimal ownership stake (<0.1%)
- No transparency on valuation

---

## Conclusion

Red flag detection serves user protection, not paranoia. The goal is informed decision-making—helping applicants recognize concerning patterns, understand their implications, and make conscious choices about risk acceptance.

Some opportunities with red flags are worth pursuing for specific reasons (mission alignment, learning opportunities, calculated career moves). Others should be avoided. The framework here provides structure for that assessment while respecting user autonomy to evaluate their own risk tolerance and priorities.

When in doubt, trust the pattern: one red flag is a question mark; multiple severe red flags are a stop sign.
