# Format Adaptation Guide

## Overview

This reference provides frameworks for analyzing job postings that don't follow standard corporate format. Different sectors have distinct conventions, terminology, and emphasis patterns that require adapted analysis approaches.

**Core principle:** The fundamental analysis components (requirements, keywords, culture, values) remain constant, but their application and interpretation vary by posting format. Understanding sector-specific conventions ensures accurate analysis and appropriate guidance.

---

## Format Detection Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to identify posting type and select appropriate framework:

```
Is this posting from...
├─ University/college? → Academic Framework
├─ Government agency (federal/state/local)? → Government Framework
├─ Non-profit organization? → Non-Profit Framework
├─ Company < 50 employees or mentions "startup"? → Startup Framework
├─ Position located outside user's home country? → International Framework
├─ Clearly temporary or project-based? → Contract/Freelance Framework
└─ Standard corporate structure? → Default Framework
```

**Hybrid detection:** Some postings combine formats (e.g., government-funded academic position). Apply multiple frameworks as needed.

## Academic Posting Framework

### Key Characteristics

Academic postings emphasize credentials, research, teaching, and service—the "three pillars" of academic careers. Structure and language differ significantly from corporate postings.

### Terminology Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Tenure-track** | Position leading to potential permanent employment with academic freedom protections |
| **Non-tenure-track / Lecturer** | Teaching-focused position without tenure possibility |
| **Adjunct** | Part-time, course-by-course appointment (often underpaid, no benefits) |
| **Visiting** | Temporary appointment, typically 1-3 years |
| **Research faculty** | Research-focused, often grant-funded, may not have teaching duties |
| **Assistant Professor** | Entry-level tenure-track (PhD + 0-5 years) |
| **Associate Professor** | Mid-career (typically tenured) |
| **Full Professor** | Senior rank, highest standard academic title |
| **Teaching load** | Number of courses per semester (e.g., "2-2 load" = 2 courses fall, 2 spring) |
| **Service** | Committee work, advising, administration |
| **R1/R2** | Carnegie Classification - R1 = highest research activity |

### Posting Structure Patterns

**Typical sections:**
1. Position description and rank
2. Institution overview
3. Responsibilities (teaching, research, service proportions)
4. Required qualifications (education, publications, teaching)
5. Preferred qualifications
6. Application materials (CV, research statement, teaching philosophy, references)
7. Application deadline and timeline
8. EEO/diversity statement

### Analysis Adaptations

**Credential emphasis:**
- PhD or terminal degree almost always required (non-negotiable)
- Publication record critical for research positions
- Teaching experience expected (TA experience counts for early-career)
- Dissertation topic and advisor reputation matter

**Research vs. Teaching balance:**

Decode from language:
- Heavy research emphasis: "research-active faculty," "external funding," "publication record," lighter teaching load (2-2 or less)
- Heavy teaching emphasis: "excellent teaching," higher load (3-3 or 4-4), "pedagogical innovation"
- Balanced: "research and teaching excellence," moderate load (2-2 or 2-3)

**Service expectations:**
- All positions include committee work
- More senior = more service expected
- Look for: "contribute to department governance," "advising," "curriculum development"

**Timeline considerations:**
- Academic job market runs on specific calendar (applications typically due Oct-Dec for positions starting following August)
- Long decision timelines (6+ months normal)
- Campus visits and job talks standard

### Critical Keyword Categories

**For research-focused positions:**
- Tier 1: Field-specific methodology, theoretical frameworks, publication venues
- Tier 2: Grant funding experience, research program, collaboration networks
- Tier 3: Research impact, interdisciplinary approaches

**For teaching-focused positions:**
- Tier 1: Pedagogical approaches, course design, student engagement
- Tier 2: Assessment methods, inclusive teaching, curriculum development
- Tier 3: Educational technology, learning outcomes

**Universal academic keywords:**
- "Scholarly excellence," "peer-reviewed," "curriculum," "mentorship," "academic freedom"

### Culture and Values Analysis

**Academic-specific values:**
- Intellectual rigor and scholarly integrity
- Academic freedom and shared governance
- Mentorship and student success
- Disciplinary contribution
- Collegiality (code word: important but subjective)

**Red flags specific to academia:**
- Vague about tenure criteria
- Teaching load >4-4 (except teaching-focused institutions)
- "Collegiality" overemphasized (can be used to punish dissent)
- No mention of research support or startup packages (for research positions)
- Adjunct position disguised as career opportunity

### Analysis Output Adjustments

**Emphasize:**
- Fit with department's scholarly focus
- Research agenda alignment
- Teaching philosophy compatibility
- Publication strategy and timeline
- Grant funding potential

**De-emphasize:**
- Corporate buzzwords (avoid "synergize," "stakeholders")
- Salary optimization (academic salaries relatively fixed by rank/scale)
- Rapid career advancement (academic progression is slow)

## Conclusion

Non-standard posting formats require adapted analysis while maintaining core framework components. Understanding sector-specific conventions, terminology, and emphasis patterns ensures accurate interpretation and appropriate guidance.

The key is recognizing that "requirements" means different things in different contexts—PhD required in academia is non-negotiable; "5 years experience" in startup may be flexible if you demonstrate capability. Each format has distinct logic that must be understood and respected for analysis to serve the applicant effectively.
