and the societal challenges of the student debt burden create an opportunity for CalState Fullerton to
emphasize the access to and quality of your extraordinary arts programs and to provide curriculum and
degrees of sustainable value for your students.
We have a once in a generation opportunity.
Managing CSULB’s Theater Arts Department through the pandemic, I have come to more acutely
appreciate the essential role of a dean in a college's success and direction. Having provided steady
and compassionate leadership through this extraordinary crisis myself, I am confident that my unique
combination of professional experiences, academic work, and service as an advocate/liaison/voice for
the general public provides me with the breadth and depth of skills and capacities from which to
successfully lead the College of the Arts at Cal State Fullerton into the future.
I believe the dean of an arts college should be a listener, translator, storyteller, manager, partner, and
champion. Or more simply, a dean should make things better. That ‘better’ can only be discovered after
listening carefully to the institution, recognizing the essential values and mission already contained
within the practices, programs, and people; from there, the job forks into expanding that mission and
focusing it so it delivers its greatest impact while building the additional revenue and partnerships that
make the conditions of its production more efficient and clear; through identifying, crafting, and
championing the compelling stories of impact and excellence from across the institution, the dean
shares those stories will all that will listen (and even some that won’t) — all the while managing college
resources, not only the financial, but also the physical and human, in a transparent, equitable, and
efficient manner to best serve students consistent with the mission and values of the college and the
university.
In the following pages, by using your search prospectus as an organizing principle, I share how I would
approach the role of dean at COTA. While I will briefly mention specific qualifications from my attached
curriculum vitae, I will focus on my vision and leadership style. Should you find my approach
compelling, I would welcome the opportunity for further conversation.
It's about the students. It's about the future.
STRATEGIC ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP
20% - Fosters Inclusive Education and Scholarship
If we believe our students are the future of our disciplines, we value our fields, and we embrace our
responsibility to the communities we serve across Southern California, we have no choice but to
dedicate ourselves to inclusive education and scholarship.
There are many similarities between CSUF and CSULB. And while I, of course, realize that I can only
understand the full complexity and needs of CSUF’s COTA by listening closely to the differences and
details shared by members of your community, at a top-level, the demographics at both institutions
reveal similar challenges. You are serving a brilliantly diverse student population with a faculty that
does not look like your students. If the challenges at Fullerton echo those at Long Beach, that gap in
representation carries into the curriculum and pedagogy. Do our students see themselves reflected in
their learning?
As our respective fields grapple with a lack of diversity, changing audiences, and shifting philanthropy,
choosing not to face this challenge is not an option.
I'm reminded of wise words Gordon Davidson shared as founding artistic director of Center Theater
Group: “You direct the play with the cast you have for the audience you’ve got."

RE: Managing Director Position
Dear Ms. Bruice,
I am pleased to submit an application for the Managing Director position at the Ensemble Theater Company.
For the past two decades, I have dedicated myself to the creation and support of new artists, new work, new
spaces, and new audiences for the American theatre. I have pursued this vision in a variety of roles: as
Associate Producer of New Play Development for Center Theatre Group, I supported the development of over
100 new works for the theatre and oversaw the restoration of the landmark building that became the Kirk
Douglas Theatre; as Producer and General Manager for the Shakespeare Center of Los Angeles, I was
responsible for all business, development, and production activities for the $1.6 million theater and created a
new outdoor venue for the company; as an independent creative producer, director, and arts administrator, I
have fostered the work of new playwrights, directors and institutions; as theatre critic for local NPR affiliate,
KCRW, I have tried to provide context and criticism while generating a broader audience for the theatre in Los
Angeles. In all of these capacities, I have committed myself to changing the landscape of theatre in Los
Angeles while connecting with the field nationally and internationally.
The idea of bringing that experience and passion to Santa Barbara, a city that holds a special place in my
heart, would be something of a dream. Santa Barbara is where I first landed in California, it’s where my wife
and I were married, and where, as an odd quirk of loyalty, I still get my haircut. I’ve watched from afar with
great curiosity the renovation and opening of the New Vic, your adventurous yet accessible seasons, and
your long standing commitment to professional theater in Santa Barbara. I would relish the opportunity to join
your theater and community and consider it an honor to help insure its success and sustainability as it
approaches such a significant anniversary.
Should you find my qualifications compelling, I would welcome a conversation about making that dream a
reality. If you need any further information or have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
Anthony Byrnes

### Unknown - my_documents/converted/Anthony Byrnes - Executive Director 2014 Final.pdf

**Pattern**: "I look forward to learning more about the Broad search and an opportunity to engage more deeply in this
conversation with you."

**Context**: Anthony Byrnes - The Broad Stage 4 of 4
COLLABORATION
Once we begin thinking deeply and institutionally about connection, the next step is collaboration. As
crowded as Los Angeles' cultural landscape is becoming, there is precious little collaboration between cultural
institutions. The Broad's partnership with the LA Opera is a promising step but the potential, and I believe the
necessity, is far greater. While we all know the challenges and hurdles, they are not excuses for a lack of
coordination, at the very least, and citywide leveraging as an achievable goal. Thinking conservatively, a
coordination or recognition of schedules would help everyone's marketing and outreach. As a community of
arts organizations, we are doing little to nurture the devoted audience that we all share. Why can't we
coordinate openings amongst institutions and articulate 'seasons' to avoid cannibalizing each other's press
and focus? Or where schedule unavoidably collide create a critical mass that leverages the accumulation?
Thinking more ambitiously, the Getty's Pacific Standard Time, for all its bumps and stumbles, demonstrated
the potential of city-wide artistic collaboration (of course, there's the more cautionary tale of the LA Opera's
Ring Cycle attempt). Los Angeles is hungry for a performing arts institution to provide leadership that focuses
and excites the city. Obviously these overtures would require both time and caution (one would necessarily
need to proceed with an eye to 'first do no harm' to existing initiatives, funding, and audience).
Or thinking opportunistically, the great artistic minds and work of Los Angeles artists, from disciplines ranging
from art and architecture to the more commercial arts supported by Hollywood and the web, have not found
an intellectual home and forum to share ideas. One needs to harken back to Paul Holdengräber's inspired
and cross-cultural conversations at LACMA to find examples of an arts organization serving as
interdisciplinary and intellectual forum.
The Broad is uniquely positioned to meet these challenges and assume a leadership that could reinforce its
support and strengthen it's philanthropic reach. The collaborative opportunities could change The Broad's
relationship to the cultural community: adapting from an institution that caters to it - to one where the Broad is
weaving the civic and cultural fabric that helps enrich the community itself. The possibilities are inspiring . . .
INTEGRITY
I hope through briefly sharing some guiding principles and strategies, you get a sense for my level of
engagement. I trust that all viable prospects for the Broad's leadership will argue for the integrity of the art,
for the work onstage. While that certainly is job one of any director, I want to argue for integrity institutionally:
for integrity that infuses all the programming, management, fundraising, outreach, and civic engagement of
the Broad. Given the creative and imaginative leap that's necessary to support the arts in the 21st century,
the least we can do as arts organizations is reward that courage with our own steadfast dedication to creating
the inspired institutions worthy of that support.
I look forward to learning more about the Broad search and an opportunity to engage more deeply in this
conversation with you.
Thanks for your time and attention.
Sincerely,
Anthony Byrnes

### Unknown - my_documents/converted/AJB cover letter- PROJECT AUDIENCE.pdf

**Pattern**: "I look forward to continuing the transparent and
comprehensive culture that Project Audience has already created and to passionately and articulately
inspiring others to join the effort."

**Context**: Technology Management and Oversight
Beyond the technological integration, coordination, consultant oversight and management required for the Kirk
Douglas Theater, I have also overseen the creation of the first university-wide arts website at USC. While far more
modest in its technical goals, the website did provide a microcosm of the political and technical issues involved with
getting different organizations (in this case, five distinct art schools within the University) to collaborate. The site
resulted in /arts becoming a top-level university domain.
• I have also personally designed relational databases and web solutions for small work groups (from five to 25
users). Again, while vastly more modest than the goals of Project Audience, this experience gives me the
structural basis to speak the language and manage not only the theoretical issues but also their practical
implementation.
• The flip side of managing technology is managing the anxiety and fear of technology by end users and
organizations. Whether this is a question of education (providing the metaphors and explanations for the
problem), inspiration (revealing the promise of the technology), or adoption (translating the benefits of the
technology into the lingua franca of the organization), I have the ability to manage both the technology and
the fear it engenders.
Collaboration, Communication, Inspiration
Project Audience has, in fact, many audiences and many stakeholders. Taking care of each of those audiences and
engaging every stakeholder is central to the project’s success. I regard this responsibility as fundamental to the
challenge of successfully directing the effort. Based on my previous experience, I believe I have an appreciation for
each audience and a facility for understanding their needs. For example:
• Non-Profit Board
Through my work at CTG, I understand the culture, responsibility, collaboration, and
communication necessary to realize projects in the non-profit world. As Project Audience defines its
governing structure, particular care will need to be paid to this relationship as both the project and the board
structure come into being.
• Funders and Key Stakeholders
Candidly, in my previous roles, I have witnessed both effective and terrible communication with funders and
key stakeholders. What I have learned is that the communication, involvement and inspiration of funders and
stakeholders must be a core principle of the organization. I look forward to continuing the transparent and
comprehensive culture that Project Audience has already created and to passionately and articulately
inspiring others to join the effort.
• Institutional Development
Project Audience is creating not only a technology solution but also a new institution (or possibly a new
branch of an institution). This requires someone who can not only manage a design process but
simultaneously create a culture within which each new partner or staff member works. I was able to not only
build a building with the Kirk Douglas Theater but create an entire staff and a culture of production.
In addition to the skills outlined in your job description, I believe I bring the following skills to Project Audience:
Vision
I share Project Audience’s view that this solution is just one part of a constellation of services that can profoundly
transform the way the arts are engaged and practiced. There will clearly be many functions, many goals that will be

Dear Professor Backer:
I am writing to apply for the adjunct Lecturer in Movement opening in the undergraduate program.
For the last 14 years I have dedicated myself to two parallel journeys in the theater: one beginning with the body, the other
beginning with the text.
The work with text is exemplified by my work as Associate Producer for New Play Development at Center Theater Group
and continues in my work as a creative producer and teacher. I have helped develop over 100 new works for the theater.
This intimate relationship with text, structure and dramaturgy deeply informs my physical work and provides a broader
context for my teaching.
The work with the body is substantiated in my 14 years of training with the SITI Company and Anne Bogart in the Suzuki
Method of Actor Training and the Viewpoints - trainings that I have taught at many levels ranging from professional
working actors to high school students. Unlike many who teach these trainings after a brief encounter with the work, I am
teaching based on a deep understanding of the trainings experientially, practically, and theoretically. I teach not only the
formal trainings but also their history and context.
While my disciplines are not Lecoq or mask training, knowing what I do about the USC program I think Suzuki and
Viewpoints would not only fit but help leverage the rest of your curriculum. I would welcome the opportunity to talk both
about USC’s curricular needs and how these trainings might address those needs.
Attached please find my resume, references, and teaching philosophy. If you need any additional information or have
further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

RE: General Manager Position
To Whom It May Concern,
I am pleased to submit an application for the General Manager position at Theater Aspen.
Rewinding several decades to the late 80’s, it was a beautiful summer in Aspen (one of my last after a
childhood growing up there). Artistically it was something of a banner year, I had the good fortune of roles at
both Theater Aspen, in a hoot of a play titled “Drunken Grownups” by Mark Routhier, and a role in “The
Cherry Orchard” at the Snowmass/Aspen Repertory Theater. Between that and a high school job spinning
pizzas at NY Pizza on the mall, it was an idyllic summer.
Fast forward and in the intervening decades, I have dedicated myself to the creation and support of new
artists, new work, new spaces, and new audiences for the American theatre. I have pursued this vision in a
variety of roles: as Associate Producer of New Play Development for Center Theatre Group, I supported the
development of over 100 new works for the theatre and oversaw the restoration of the landmark building that
became the Kirk Douglas Theatre; as Producer and General Manager for the Shakespeare Center of Los
Angeles I was responsible for all business and production activities for the $1.5 million theater and created a

have fostered the work of new playwrights, directors and institutions; as theatre critic for local NPR affiliate,
KCRW, I have tried to provide context and criticism while generating a broader audience for the theatre in Los
Angeles. I have committed myself to changing the landscape of theatre in Los Angeles while connecting with
the field nationally and internationally.
The idea of returning to my childhood home, Aspen, with the skills and passion for theater that I’ve honed
over the past decades is something of a fantastical dream - akin to the fairy magic of Midsummer.
Should you find my qualifications compelling, I would welcome a conversation about making that dream a

Colburn School

RE: General Manager of Performances & Events Division
Dear Members of the Search Committee,
In October 2004, eight miles southwest of Colburn, the Kirk Douglas Theatre opened on time and on
budget to a fully subscribed first season. When we first went to Culver City in 1997, they 'rolled up the
sidewalks at 6pm'—there were scarce dinner options within walking distance, and the Culver Theatre,
which would become the Kirk Douglas, was home to hundreds of pigeons, not artists and audiences.
Driving through Culver City today, it's hard to believe the transformation. This experience taught me the
profound power of place-making: how creating a culture of place—a welcoming, vital venue—doesn't
just transmit art but transforms the ecosystem and people that surround it. As the Colburn Center
prepares to open in 2027, I would be honored to bring my experience and understanding to your once-
in-a-generation project.
Opening a major new venue is rare. Building an entirely new Performances & Events Division from the
ground up is rarer still. Having shepherded the Kirk Douglas Theatre through this full lifecycle—from
architect selection through commissioning and producing the inaugural season—I recognize this role at
the Colburn as the opportunity to apply everything I've learned to a project of even greater scale and
impact.
What draws me to this role is the chance to return to the work I find most meaningful and challenging:
building a team, welcoming an audience, and establishing the sustainable processes that allow a venue
to thrive. There is a particular thrill in creating a culture of place—one that nurtures artists, supports
students, employs skilled professionals, and makes a city feel at home in a new venue. I've
experienced this transformation twice, and the prospect of doing it again at Colburn, with new
performance venues and an expanded mission, is deeply compelling.
My experience with capital projects and cultural infrastructure speaks directly to this opportunity.
Beyond the Kirk Douglas Theatre, I oversaw the $450,000 renovation of CTG's Ivy Substation and
designed/built the Shakespeare Center's 600-seat outdoor amphitheater—each time creating not just
physical spaces but complete operational models and staff structures. More recently, as Interim
Associate Dean at CSULB's College of the Arts, I've built institutional infrastructure at a different scale:
comprehensive scheduling databases that optimize 945 unique spaces serving 4,600 students, through
an integrated data architecture that unites previously siloed operations and reports. By nature, I am a
systems thinker. All my work strives to support, and understand, the whole. I understand how disparate
pieces fit together: how the ethos of the crew affects the comfort of the performers; how the attitude of
the usher sets the stage for an audience to experience a work of art; how a simple schedule change
can affect both revenue models and student success. Building sustainable infrastructure means
creating systems that work not just individually but as a coherent whole, allowing institutions to grow
without constantly reinventing the wheel.
I bring proven revenue generation across every stream you have identified in the job description. At
Shakespeare Center, I transitioned the organization from a free theater model to earned revenue,
achieving 20% year-over-year ticket growth while managing all ancillary revenue operations including
concessions, merchandise, facility fees, and major sponsorships (which, along with a more strategic
look at our patron data, grew an already successful annual gala by 100%). As producer/general

**Pattern**: "These are not easy meetings for students—they’ve tried twice and haven’t made it across the line, and
it can feel like being sent to the principal’s office."

**Context**: ANTHONY BYRNES - Cover Letter page 2 of 6
These changes reduced our highest advising caseload from 665 to 389 students—a 41% improvement
—and allowed our advising lead to refocus his time on critical leadership tasks instead of direct
advising. While the solution is not yet permanent, it represents a significant step toward a more
equitable, proactive, student-centered advising culture.
To sustain this progress, at the beginning of the 24-25 academic year, I invited four of our advising
leads to join me on a University Data Fellows project to identify and catalogue equity gaps among
COTA students. This initiative will help better position COTA for future funding opportunities as part of
the Chancellor’s new program to replace GI2015 and will further elevate the visibility and expertise of
our advisors across the university.
The progress I have been able make in this area reflects my ability to effectively collaborate within
COTA and across the university, creatively address challenges within existing structures and funding
mechanisms, and remain committed to equity and excellence for our students, staff, and faculty.
Strategic Planning Process
One of Dean Smith’s key priorities when he began in his role was the development of a long-overdue
strategic plan for the College. To lead this effort, he engaged an outside consulting firm and appointed
Associate Dean Chiara Ferrari and me as co-chairs of the process. Chiara and I began our work with a
22-person steering committee and a foundational plan developed by the consultant.
We quickly realized that while the consultant’s plan could guide the creation of a strategic plan, it would
not foster the conditions necessary for its success within the college. COTA’s culture and ethos required
a more open and inclusive process. Additionally, the steering committee—comprised of staff, faculty, a
student, and an alumnus—took on this demanding work alongside their full schedules and without
additional compensation.
Chiara and I quickly developed a parallel process to the consultant’s plan, designed to foster broader
engagement and reimagine the steering committee’s role. We also recognized the importance of
incorporating input from students, faculty, staff, alumni, and donors. To achieve this, we implemented
college-wide surveys, organized a day of focus group meetings, and facilitated several group retreats.
For the committee, we fostered a meeting culture that respected members’ time by using meetings to
engage their voices and opinions rather than simply provide updates. This required us to support the
committee by sharing relevant information in advance and carefully scheduling meetings around their
availability.
Chiara and I transformed the committee from a reserved and skeptical group at the first meeting into a
collaborative team that, by the final meeting, worked efficiently and creatively resulting in a first draft of
a strategic plan that reflected multiple feedback points from across the college.
I share this experience to highlight my strong collaborative partnership with Chiara and our mutual
respect for students, faculty, and staff, as well as their contributions to the college’s shared goals. I
believe the strategic plan reflects this ethos and commitment.
Third Attempt Meetings
I’ll be honest: third-attempt meetings are my favorite part of the position. These occur when a student
who has failed a class twice has to meet with the Associate Dean to seek permission for a third attempt.
These are not easy meetings for students—they’ve tried twice and haven’t made it across the line, and
it can feel like being sent to the principal’s office. They’re challenging for me, too, as the stories are

Dear Members of the COTA Associate Dean Search Committee,
For the past 15 months, I have had the honor of serving as the Interim Associate Dean for Student
Success and Outreach at CSULB’s College of the Arts (COTA). Based on this experience and the work
in front of us as an institution, I am writing to enthusiastically apply for the Associate Dean for Student
Success and Outreach position. To highlight my qualifications and share my approach and passion for
this work, I am providing examples from three key facets of my work in the role as interim associate
dean. These examples illustrate the deep sense of service that guides my commitment to this role, our
college, and, most importantly, our students.
Undergraduate Advising
When I assumed the Interim Associate Dean position, our undergraduate advisors carried
unmanageable caseloads of 400 to 665 students each—among the highest on campus. This issue,
identified in a 2021 external program review, was compounded by a lack of resources and a specialized
advising structure that made centralized solutions infeasible. When I joined the COTA office in fall of
2023, there was no plan or strategy to address the issue. The advisors were overworked, and it was
directly affecting students.
To address this challenge, I thoroughly researched the problem to develop a clear understanding of it
both within COTA and across the university. I benchmarked against other colleges across campus and
developed a concise infographic (see below) to communicate COTA’s unique challenges and advocate
for change.
The next challenge was to identify funds to support additional advising within the existing resource
constraints of the institution. This required a deep understanding of CSULB’s complex funding
structures and collaboration with stakeholders within COTA and the broader university. By developing a
novel funding proposal and holding targeted meetings to contextualize and clarify the issue, with the
Dean’s support, I was able to successfully identify funding to secure four temporary and 1 permanent
hire in advance of the 2024-2025 academic year.

a weekly audience of over 300,000; as Director of Cultural Relations for USC; as a teacher at Los
Angeles County High School for the Arts; as a producer, general manager, and managing director for
several local theater companies; and at California State University Long Beach where I currently serve
as Interim Associate Dean for Student Success and Outreach for the College of the Arts, which serves
4,600 students across 23 nationally recognized, accredited degree programs, with 100 full-time faculty
and more than 300 part-time faculty across six schools and departments. Prior to my role as Interim
Associate Dean, I served as Chair of CSULB’s Theatre Arts Department and program head of the joint
MBA/MFA degree in Theatre Management.
In all these engagements, I draw on my profound respect for artists and scholars, creative practice and
scholarship across disciplines, the audience, and an appreciation of the broader artistic ecosystem and
communities we serve. I believe the arts are not only vital within the university, but also are the
essential weavers of the fabric of a just, equitable society.
I am inspired to apply for the position of dean because I believe the UCLA School of Theater, Film and
Television is uniquely positioned to lead during this historic moment. As part of the nation’s premier
public university, located in the creative capital of the world, the school holds a diverse student body,
faculty, and staff deeply committed to both creation and scholarship in pursuit of a more inclusive
future. This aligns closely with my personal values and professional goals. I am confident that my skills,
experience, and passion can help the school fulfill its mission and realize its extraordinary potential.
Listening before acting is a cornerstone of my leadership approach, particularly when engaging those
who may have been excluded from such conversations in the past. I believe that it is only from this
deeply attuned and informed perspective that one can cultivate productive partnerships, develop
effective strategies, and successfully connect with and communicate within a community. While I have
not yet had the opportunity to hear directly from the faculty, students, staff, and donors who comprise
the TFT community, I recognize theirs are the essential voices. As you seek a transformational leader to
help the school realize its fullest potential, allow me to share, from an external perspective and without
the benefit of those conversations, what my top priorities and questions as an incoming dean would be.
Enhancing Scholarship and Creative Practice
My first priority would be to enhance the impact of and support for the creative practice and scholarship
of the school’s faculty. As an R1 Land Grant university, the school’s strength, value and impact depend
on the success, morale, and productivity of its faculty. This includes their contributions in the classroom,
their creative practice, research, and scholarship, and their leadership in reimagining our shared
disciplines. For me, inclusive excellence is not just an initiative or a priority within this charge—
it is a core, foundational imperative that will continue to strengthen and amplify the impact and reach of
TFT. It will be through and because of our rich diversity—as scholars, artists, students, and staff—that

Dear Dean Smith,
It is with great enthusiasm that I submit this letter of interest for the position of Acting Associate Dean of
Student Success & Outreach at COTA.
The opportunity to be a part of the COTA leadership team, help advocate and ensure student success,
and help the units and departments of COTA better serve our students would be an honor.
It's about the students. It's about the future.
Our students are the future of our fields.
The very viability of our varied respective artistic disciplines depends on them. As the future artists and
leaders of Southern California and beyond, our civic fabric and the health and richness of our
communities relies on our work as educators. We fulfill not only our mission as a state university, but
also our calling as artists by diversifying our fields and extending their promise for the next generation.
I believe that the COTA community is uniquely positioned by the strength of our programs, the talent of
our faculty and the commitment of our staff to meet these challenges and ensure that the future of the
arts is more diverse and our students more prepared and engaged than any previous generation. The
rising awareness of the cost of tuition at private universities and the societal challenges of the student
debt burden create an opportunity for COTA to emphasize the access to and quality of our
extraordinary arts programs and to provide curriculum and degrees of sustainable value for our
students.
We have a once in a generation opportunity.
My 7 years of service at CSULB, including the past three years as chair of Theatre Arts, has clarified
both the demands and untapped promise of COTA specifically, and CSULB more broadly. As a
respected member of the COTA chairs and directors team, I have both a collegial respect and
understanding for the discrete and shared challenges of our students, our departments, and the
broader college and university. I see the areas where existing practice is essential and also where we
can greatly improve our work, capacity, and impact as a college. I appreciate where we can learn from
the success of the work of one department and where we are served by respecting the idiosyncratic
needs of our different disciplines.
Connecting our students with the broader ecosystem.
For the past 25 years, I have dedicated myself to developing artists, art, and audiences for Southern
California theater. I have done this as the Associate Producer of New Play Development at Center
Theatre Group where I had the privilege of building the Kirk Douglas Theatre and nurturing over 100
new plays for the American theater; as a theater critic for KCRW, Southern California’s local NPR
affiliate reaching a weekly audience of over 300,000; as Director of Cultural Relations for USC; as a

The resulting building embraced universal design delivering a theater that could, with removable seats,
rows, and an elevator, accommodate a full 30% of its audience in wheelchairs, far exceeding ADA
requirements. The theater we built wasn’t only more accessible for people using wheelchairs, it was a
more welcoming theater for the entire audience and everyone who worked there. Universal design was
good design.
This experience changed how I thought about diversity and accessibility and my role as an advocate
and ally. Were it not for John’s presence and friendship the very architecture of the building would be
different.
I have learned that a commitment to a diverse, welcoming culture must be continual and requires a
humble desire to constantly learn and evolve.
I became Chair of the Theatre Arts Department at CSULB the summer of George Floyd’s murder.
Prompted by the national reckoning that followed, our student body shared stories of the pain, trauma,
and exclusion that they had experienced within our department. I began an ongoing process to change
the department culture by retaining the California Center for Equality and Justice to engage students,
faculty, and staff in a restorative justice process that would help us understand how the culture of our
department was unwelcoming and exclusive. The process, with an all white tenured faculty, myself
included, has not been easy.
That initial engagement has extended to: a re-examination of the department curriculum; broad student
engagement and enfranchisement; the development and implementation of new transparent policies
and procedures that involve students in season selection, removal of gatekeeping policies and
practices; a commitment to the centering of student work; and the development of a framework and
methodology for an ongoing interrogation of our pedagogical strategies and materials.
While I am quite proud of the progress we have made, there is much more work to do and we are still
only at the beginning of what I know will be an enduring journey.
The lesson I am learning every day is how profound one’s commitment to this ongoing work must be. I
discover with each semester how deep the structural barriers are and how much work still needs to be
done. There is no other choice. If we are to equitably serve our students and fulfill our mission as
educators for our communities, we must ensure this process is continual and ever present.
I know that our schools and communities, like the theater John Belluso made better, will be more
welcoming for all of us.

ADDENDA: Diversity Statement
(While not a required document for application, I am respectfully submitting this diversity statement as
an important reflection on my values and how I have approached my work throughout my professional
career.)
I have had the good fortune to be engaged in diverse, vibrant artistic dialogues since the beginning of
my professional career as Associate Producer for New Play Development at Center Theatre Group
(CTG). When I joined CTG in 1997, the Taper Playwright Labs were already well established: LTI -
Latino Theatre Initiative, Blacksmyths, ATW - Asian Theatre Workshop, Writers Workshop, and Other
Voices - a lab for playwrights and artists with disabilities. Our collective raison d’être was to champion
and produce new diverse stories that represented the communities of Southern California.
While my work and personal values were deeply impacted by all the remarkable artists with whom I
was privileged to work, I want to share the impact the playwright John Belluso had on me, and
ultimately on the architecture of the Kirk Douglas Theatre and Mark Taper Forum.
John used a wheelchair. He had a degenerative bone disease that ultimately took his life. He was a
fierce advocate and champion for the disabled community. Access, equity, anger, and appreciation
coursed through his political plays.
John also didn’t have a car. In L.A., that meant since all of us in New Play Development travelled in a
pack, that we all became intimately familiar with the obstacles that John faced as we travelled to
second story theaters and rehearsal rooms without ramps. This came to a head when John received
the Sherwood Award at the Taper. The award ceremony traditionally took place on the opening night of
a production and involved having the honoree join Gordon Davidson on stage. The Taper had
wheelchair accessible seats in the theater, but it had no ramp backstage and all the dressing rooms
were up a flight of stairs. To accept his award, John was supposed to make it from the audience to the
stage. There was no accessible route. The architecture of the building never contemplated that
someone using a wheelchair might be an artist on stage.
It was a painful realization.
At the same time, I was working with the architects and theater consultants on the new Kirk Douglas
Theatre. The theatre consultants, who had been engaged on the project before the architects, had
designed a theater that required everyone in the audience to go up a flight of stairs to enter the theater.
It was a lovely design, but save for an elevator that would allow someone to sit in the very back row,
totally inaccessible.
John’s presence on our artistic staff and as a friend made that wholly unacceptable. There was no way I
could share a set of plans that excluded John who had extolled the merits of universal design.
I worked with our production department to come up with a different design strategy that had the entire
theater from the backstage dressing rooms to the front entrance all on a single level: meaning both
artists and audience—whether they used a wheelchair or not—could gain access to the theater without
encountering a single stair.
In June of 2002, I proudly shared the plans with John, but sheepishly apologized that there were indeed
stairs in the building in addition to an elevator. John wasn’t finished teaching me when he said, “It’s not
about removing all challenges. It’s about ensuring that everyone has a choice which challenges they
want to tackle.”

Dear Members of the COTA Dean Search Committee,
It is with great enthusiasm that I submit this letter of interest for the position of dean of the College of
the Arts at California State University, Long Beach.
My experience teaching and managing at CSULB and as a part of COTA since 2016 has clarified both
the demands and untapped promise of COTA specifically, and CSULB more broadly. With the onset of
the pandemic in 2020, we discovered the potential of teaching arts online and simultaneously
encountered its profound limitations. As a college, we experienced just how essential the COTA office is
to the resiliency and effectiveness of each and every department, unit, and school that comprise it. We
saw how critical it is for a vision of the future to engage and respect all the voices of the college and to
collaboratively and transparently bring everyone along, with anything less proving unsustainable.
Alongside these challenges, we also experienced the glorious resiliency and desire of students who
were suddenly dancing in their bedrooms, acting through a webcam, sketching their family rather than a
live model, playing and singing through a mask, filming at a distance, and taking design critiques over
zoom. Through all of this difficulty, our students created remarkable work, supported by a dedicated,
problem-solving staff, and nurtured by an engaged, creative faculty. The passion of our students
triumphed over the challenges and reminded us of the future we are building with every class, every
student, in every interaction.
This trial by fire has focused me on what I believe I have to offer the university and the college as its
next dean. While the past never offers a blueprint for the future, it can sketch the outlines of the critical
path forward and bring into stark relief the essential issues that must be addressed and opportunities
waiting to be seized. I am eager to help COTA do both as we chart a promising and sustainable path
into the future.
For the past 25 years, I have dedicated myself to developing artists, art, and audiences for Southern
California theater. I have done this as the Associate Producer of New Play Development at Center
Theatre Group where I had the privilege of building the Kirk Douglas Theatre and nurturing over 100

across disciplines, the audience, and an appreciation of the broader artistic ecosystem and
communities we serve. I believe the arts are not only critical within a university, I believe they are the

My curriculum vitae will provide a fuller articulation of my experience, and I trust that if you find my
vision and qualifications compelling, we will have further opportunity to discuss my candidacy.

and the societal challenges of the student debt burden create an opportunity for CalState Fullerton to
emphasize the access to and quality of your extraordinary arts programs and to provide curriculum and
degrees of sustainable value for your students.
We have a once in a generation opportunity.
Managing CSULB’s Theater Arts Department through the pandemic, I have come to more acutely
appreciate the essential role of a dean in a college's success and direction. Having provided steady
and compassionate leadership through this extraordinary crisis myself, I am confident that my unique
combination of professional experiences, academic work, and service as an advocate/liaison/voice for
the general public provides me with the breadth and depth of skills and capacities from which to
successfully lead the College of the Arts at Cal State Fullerton into the future.
I believe the dean of an arts college should be a listener, translator, storyteller, manager, partner, and
champion. Or more simply, a dean should make things better. That ‘better’ can only be discovered after
listening carefully to the institution, recognizing the essential values and mission already contained
within the practices, programs, and people; from there, the job forks into expanding that mission and
focusing it so it delivers its greatest impact while building the additional revenue and partnerships that
make the conditions of its production more efficient and clear; through identifying, crafting, and
championing the compelling stories of impact and excellence from across the institution, the dean
shares those stories will all that will listen (and even some that won’t) — all the while managing college
resources, not only the financial, but also the physical and human, in a transparent, equitable, and
efficient manner to best serve students consistent with the mission and values of the college and the
university.
In the following pages, by using your search prospectus as an organizing principle, I share how I would
approach the role of dean at COTA. While I will briefly mention specific qualifications from my attached
curriculum vitae, I will focus on my vision and leadership style. Should you find my approach
compelling, I would welcome the opportunity for further conversation.
It's about the students. It's about the future.
STRATEGIC ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP
20% - Fosters Inclusive Education and Scholarship
If we believe our students are the future of our disciplines, we value our fields, and we embrace our
responsibility to the communities we serve across Southern California, we have no choice but to
dedicate ourselves to inclusive education and scholarship.
There are many similarities between CSUF and CSULB. And while I, of course, realize that I can only
understand the full complexity and needs of CSUF’s COTA by listening closely to the differences and
details shared by members of your community, at a top-level, the demographics at both institutions
reveal similar challenges. You are serving a brilliantly diverse student population with a faculty that
does not look like your students. If the challenges at Fullerton echo those at Long Beach, that gap in
representation carries into the curriculum and pedagogy. Do our students see themselves reflected in
their learning?
As our respective fields grapple with a lack of diversity, changing audiences, and shifting philanthropy,
choosing not to face this challenge is not an option.
I'm reminded of wise words Gordon Davidson shared as founding artistic director of Center Theater
Group: “You direct the play with the cast you have for the audience you’ve got."

Our Moment.
As we continue to emerge from a global pandemic, it is clear that our artistic fields and our academic
environments are forever changed. We may not yet be able to fully grasp how, but the shifts are
undeniable. The performing arts are welcoming audiences back in diminished numbers. All of our
artistic disciplines are grappling with a new awareness of the critical work necessary to represent our
communities and carry art forward.
Our students, changed by learning via full days on zoom and having missed rites of in-person passage,
come to our classrooms bearing greater burdens and needs than before. Our faculty and staff are
stretched beyond capacity as we tackle an enrollment shift that reverses the rising tide of the past
decades. The pandemic is revealing already existing cracks in our institutional foundation. The same
reckoning that roils the professional field challenges generational assumptions that have held for
decades in our classrooms.
Against this backdrop, why would I want to be the dean of the College of the Arts at CalState Fullerton?
Why now? Why CalState Fullerton?
Your students at CalState Fullerton are the future of our fields. I would argue that the very viability of
our varied respective artistic disciplines depends on them. As the future artists and leaders of Southern
California and beyond, our civic fabric and the health and richness of our communities relies on your
work. We fulfill not only our mission as a State University but also our calling as artists by diversifying
our fields and extending their promise for the next generation.
I believe that the College of the Arts at CalState Fullerton is uniquely positioned by the strength of your
programs, the talent of your faculty and alumni, and the commitment of your staff to meet these
challenges and ensure that the future of the arts is more diverse and our students more prepared and
engaged than any previous generation. The rising awareness of the cost of tuition at private universities

RE: Director of Performing Arts Position
Dear Mr. Castro,
Los Angeles' cultural ecosystem is at an inflection point.
You can feel it in our theaters; see it in our audiences.
On our stages, there is more virtuosic work than we've seen in the last 15 years: more glorious moments
when we are reminded of the power and immediacy of the performing arts to cut through the mediation of
technology that rules our modern lives to reconnect us with the essential questions of humanity.
Yet, our non-profits are still trying to dig out from recessionary cutbacks. Our arts leaders struggle for the
capacity to sustain their own organizations. They lack the means to build a larger city-wide collaboration of
audience and culture. Great art is playing to small, often geographically specific houses (not surprising in a
city as big as Los Angeles).
And there is the disparity between what our city looks like and what our performing arts look like: our work on
stage isn't representing or serving the diversity of our city.
How do we create the visibility, capacity, and infrastructure that nurtures virtuosity while ensuring
diversity and access?
Clearly, the primary answer to this challenge must come from the individual arts organizations that make up
our ecosystem: how they meet the world and the profundity with which they believe art can be a vital part of
our society, our city.
But many of these challenges are bigger than a single organization . . .
The Performing Arts Director position, alongside the other successful initiatives and leadership of the
Department of Cultural Affairs and in concert with Mayor Garcetti's broader goals and initiatives, have the
potential to directly and meaningfully impact this challenge and bring us closer to having art reach every
single Angeleno.

Dear Ms. Bruice,
I am pleased to submit an application for the Managing Director position at the Ensemble Theater Company.
For the past two decades, I have dedicated myself to the creation and support of new artists, new work, new
spaces, and new audiences for the American theatre. I have pursued this vision in a variety of roles: as
Associate Producer of New Play Development for Center Theatre Group, I supported the development of over
100 new works for the theatre and oversaw the restoration of the landmark building that became the Kirk
Douglas Theatre; as Producer and General Manager for the Shakespeare Center of Los Angeles, I was
responsible for all business, development, and production activities for the $1.6 million theater and created a
new outdoor venue for the company; as an independent creative producer, director, and arts administrator, I
have fostered the work of new playwrights, directors and institutions; as theatre critic for local NPR affiliate,
KCRW, I have tried to provide context and criticism while generating a broader audience for the theatre in Los
Angeles. In all of these capacities, I have committed myself to changing the landscape of theatre in Los
Angeles while connecting with the field nationally and internationally.
The idea of bringing that experience and passion to Santa Barbara, a city that holds a special place in my
heart, would be something of a dream. Santa Barbara is where I first landed in California, it’s where my wife
and I were married, and where, as an odd quirk of loyalty, I still get my haircut. I’ve watched from afar with
great curiosity the renovation and opening of the New Vic, your adventurous yet accessible seasons, and
your long standing commitment to professional theater in Santa Barbara. I would relish the opportunity to join
your theater and community and consider it an honor to help insure its success and sustainability as it
approaches such a significant anniversary.
Should you find my qualifications compelling, I would welcome a conversation about making that dream a
reality. If you need any further information or have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
Anthony Byrnes

RE: Chief Operating Officer, Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts
Dear Ms. Genovese and Members of the Selection Committee,
I am pleased to submit this application for the position of Chief Operating Officer at the Wallis Annenberg
Center for Performing Arts.
In October 2004, five miles south of the Beverly Hills Post Office, the Kirk Douglas Theatre opened on time,
on budget, and to a fully subscribed first season. My involvement with Center Theatre Group’s third stage
began in 1997 with conceptual budget studies and a schematic design, quite literally, ‘on the back of the
envelope.’ For the next eight years I shepherded the Kirk Douglas Theatre through the strategic planning,
design & construction, operational planning, and finally the day-to-day management and production of the
inaugural season.
As the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts transitions from being a long held dream of Beverly
Hills to becoming a vital cultural landmark for the region, I would relish the opportunity to share my
experience, passion and dedication to help those conceptual plans become operational realities.
Having been through the process of opening a new facility, I have tackled many of the challenges that lie
ahead for the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts. I have: conceived and managed the
infrastructural and operational systems that create the foundation of a sustainable institution; created a
welcoming space for both audiences and artists; fostered a staff dedicated to excellence and committed to the
larger vision of an institution.
I combine this pragmatic experience with a structural understanding of how a theatre ‘works.’ I am as
comfortable talking to a stagehand as a major donor (and appreciate how the efforts of one affect the other).
Like a talented director who through an understanding of underlying structure can bring new, vital life to a

Dear Len,
I recently had the pleasure of meeting Jane Deknatel for breakfast to discuss the successes and recent
challenges at the Broad Stage. I wanted to take a moment to share my thoughts about those challenges and
an approach to the Broad's next chapter as it approaches it's tenth anniversary and a significant change in
leadership.
Obviously, the art is paramount. World-class, engaging, thoughtful programming is the bedrock of the Broad
Stage. I trust that all the candidates will begin with the essential primacy of the work on stage. I also trust
that should our conversation continue we'll have the opportunity to talk about that work at length and how my
two decades in the trenches of Los Angeles' cultural community equip me to uniquely guide that programming
and vision. The questions I'd like to propose are whether a programmatic vision alone is sufficient in today's

After all, the cultural and philanthropic landscape has evolved since the Broad was conceived and opened.
While an 'if you build it, they will come' approach welcomed the Broad (and before it the Geffen) on the
westside, we know that the atmosphere has changed. As the cultural landscape of Los Angeles becomes
(thankfully) more competitive and crowded; as other presenters either expand (UCLA) or begin to find their
voices (The Wallis); as southern California's regional theaters look more like 'presenters' with each season; as
museums like the Hammer are not only opening their doors free of charge but also offering programming that
competes for time and attention - The Broad has both the challenge and the opportunity to distinguish itself as
a leader. I would argue that the art, itself, while always the origin must be buttressed by a world-class
institution and vision. What I would like to share and focus on is my passion and vision for the work that
extends beyond stage: a profound belief that the demands of generating both the audience and the funding
require that our work be as inspiring off-stage as on.

RE: Executive Director - The Antaeus Company
Dear Kitty, Bill, and members of the selection committee,
I've long been a fan and admirer of Antaeus and your work and dedication. Without question, Antaeus sets
the standard for classical, intimate theater in Los Angeles. Your membership, a remarkable asset; your
commitment to the form, a beacon others could only aspire to; your reputation, burnished.
What's next? What is the company’s vision of the future? What aspirations are unmet? What challenges
remain to be conquered? And, more personally, could my experience and dedication to Los Angeles theater
and the form help Antaeus achieve those goals?
What I can offer the company is nearly two decades of committed work in Los Angeles theater. Ranging from
my work at Center Theater Group - where I produced the new play development work and oversaw the
renovation of the Kirk Douglas Theater and Ivy Substation; to my work as an educator - both hosting and
teaching the work of Anne Bogart and the SITI company and a decade of teaching at LACHSA (the County's
public performing arts high school); and higher education - serving as a cultural ambassador for USC; and as
critic for KCRW - trying to provide context for the rich ecosystem that is Los Angeles Theater. Through these
experiences, I have a deep and broad understanding of what, from the outside, appear to be Antaeus' core
programs and strengths. My appreciation and understanding of the broader theater and cultural ecosystem, I
believe, could help leverage Antaeus' strengths.
Pragmatically, my recent work at Shakespeare Center of Los Angeles (SCLA) demonstrates both my fiscal
stewardship and development abilities. In my first year with SCLA, I oversaw and managed a roughly $300k
turnaround from a deficit of nearly $200k to a surplus of over a $100k. I've led the company’s transition from
a free ticket model to an audience base that has grown 20% year over year for the last three years. I've
shepherded the implementation of a company wide information infrastructure that has ranged from the
company's first comprehensive development database, to the creation of a rational and comprehensive chart
of accounts, to a new website and branding initiative, and a company wide adoption of PatronManager/
Salesforce for both ticketing, development, and company management.

To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to apply for the part-time Finance Director Position at 18th Street Arts Center. Enclosed please
find my resume and references.
While 18th Street Arts Center reaches beyond my 20 year focus and commitment to supporting the artists of
the theatre, what it holds in common is a commitment to artists and community. I’m confident that my skills
and experience creating, managing, and implementing the systems and staff of the theater will transfer
seamlessly to your organization.
My passion and sensitivity to both the bigger goal and the underlying artistic processes are what allow me to
manage projects and organizations in a way that is both fiscally responsible and artistically fruitful. Whether
it’s the Shakespeare Center of Los Angeles that I was able to transform from a $200k deficit to $100k surplus
through both managing expenses and growing contributed income or the Kirk Douglas Theater project for
Center Theatre Group that I saw from the ‘back of napkin’ through an on-time and on-budget $18 million
capital campaign - I have the passion, discipline, and ‘big picture’ insight to help an organization achieve it’s
goals.
Should you require any additional information or would like to set up an interview to see if I might be a match
for 18th Street, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
Anthony Byrnes
P.S. - regarding salary - after reviewing your 990, I’m confident that if we find that there is a good fit we’ll be
able to negotiate compensation within your budget constraints.

**Pattern**: "Without respect for our own work how can we begin the difficult
work of making art?
Like a good director or playwright who, rather than dictating, simple creates the circumstances under which drama can happen I create
a classroom environment where actors are accountable and details are not only noticed but addressed."

**Context**: ANTHONY BYRNES TEACHING PHILOSOPHY page 3 of 13
IT BEGINS WITH THE BODY
Both of my primary disciplines, Suzuki and Viewpoints, take as their core the actor’s body in time and space.They posit that what we
have in common with the ancient Greeks, what we have in common with Shakespeare, what we have in common with Beckett, is the
human body on stage dealing with time and space. Strip away the text, the costumes, the lights, the theatrical styles, the politics of
presentation, theater’s place in a specific society and what we are left with is the body.
In our culture, particularly our theatrical culture, it is all too easy to forget about the body. Too often we see actors succumb to ‘the
tyranny of the text.’ We experience actors who can move and actors who can speak but often the act of speaking robs them of
awareness of the body.
I strive to provide my students with a profound awareness of their bodies. Beginning first with awareness then moving towards a
recognition of the habitual, those patterns of movement and tension that are unconscious and often idiosyncratic. Once there is
awareness and recognition, we can move on to articulation and exploration.
PROFESSIONAL RIGOR
The Devil is in the Details
We can debate endlessly what can and can’t be taught in the theater (i.e presence, talent, inspiration, drive). What can be instilled is a
sense of professional rigor. Actors can be taught how to ‘show up to work’ as a professional artists both physically and intellectually. I
believe more than any other ‘method‘ or skill, creating an environment that fosters this rigor and demands this presence is invaluable to
the young artist.
Ultimately, professional rigor translates into respect for one’s own work. Without respect for our own work how can we begin the difficult
work of making art?
Like a good director or playwright who, rather than dictating, simple creates the circumstances under which drama can happen I create
a classroom environment where actors are accountable and details are not only noticed but addressed. Professional rigor begins with
how we deal with and approach our space. The classroom has to be transformed, if only imaginatively, into a performance space. That
begins with the simple, small details: how we come to class, how we deal with all the extraneous stuff we all cart along with us, how we
honor time in beginning and how we attend to time throughout. These sound like insignificant steps -‘why can’t I just throw my stuff on
the floor?’ or ‘who cares if we start five minutes late?’ or ‘does it matter that it takes us fifteen minutes to begin working?’ - but ultimately
how we begin is how we end. How act one begins determines how act five ends. By attending to the small details in the beginning, we
make it possible to get to the difficult work in the middle, and the refinements in the end.
Professional rigor extends to how we work. For our training to be meaningful and to aid our students work on stage, the training should
re-create the experience of being on stage. In the classroom, I try to create a clear delineation between our training - the on stage work,
and discussion or notes - the offstage work. By drawing clear lines between the two, and not letting one blur into the other, we can
begin to look closely at the energy, presence and focus required to be ‘on stage’.
They are small, common sense details - start on time, treat the space with respect, create a sense of being on stage, demand the same
level of work in the classroom that we would on stage (or said another way rehearse with the same energy with which you perform) -
but they provide great clarity to the work.
ARTICULATION
The Role of the Audience, Failure, Articulation
The goal of any movement training, to me, is articulation.
Having helped the students gain awareness of their bodies and having cultivated a professional rigor both in how we approach work
and how we work, the next goal is finding articulate and open bodies.
The first step to articulation, perhaps counter-intuitively, is learning how to watch. Often in training programs it is easy to slide into
treating our time in the audience as opportunities to rest and judge (or even worse ‘zone out’). I encourage the students instead to find
a way of watching empathetically and to recognize that how we watch determines how we perform. In the same way that it is difficult to
pronounce a sound that we cannot hear, it is very difficult for us to be articulate ‘doing’ when we aren’t articulate ‘watching.’ Students
quickly discover that there is as much work to be done offstage watching as on.
Watching empathetically requires that we change our relationship to failure. The temptation for the audience is to judge failure and
distance themselves from it - ‘boy, he sucks. Thank god that’s not me.’ If we watch in this way our learning stops there and we don’t
really see what is happening. If instead we can enter into the failure and really see what is in front of us then we can learn from it.
Suddenly, failure becomes information. It is difficult for young artists to appreciate that making great art requires a different relationship

Dear Mr. Beeman:
I am writing in regards to the “General Lecturer Pool Search.”
For the last 14 years I have dedicated myself to two parallel journeys in the theater: one beginning with the body, the other
beginning with the text.
The work with the body is substantiated in my 14 years of training with the SITI Company and Anne Bogart in the Suzuki
Method of Actor Training and the Viewpoints - trainings that I have taught at many levels ranging from professional
working actors to high school students. Unlike many who teach these trainings after a brief encounter with the work, I am
teaching based on a deep understanding of the trainings experientially, practically, and theoretically. I teach not only the
formal trainings but also their history and context.
Beginning with the Body:
Stage Movement
Suzuki
Viewpoints

The work with text is exemplified by my work as Associate Producer for New Play Development at Center Theater Group
and continues in my work as a creative producer and teacher. I have helped develop over 100 new works for the theater.
This intimate relationship with text, structure and dramaturgy deeply informs my physical work and provides a broader
context for my teaching.

To the members of the Project Audience Oversight Committee,
I am pleased to submit this application for the role of Program Director for Project Audience. I have been engaged in the
challenges of audience development for many years in many different roles: as a passionate audience member, an artist,
a producer and arts administrator within a major regional theater striving to create a body of work and cultivate the
participation of new artists and audiences, as an university liaison to the arts community trying to foster cultural literacy
and nurture the arts patrons of tomorrow, as a teacher both to the professional field and to aspiring high school students,
and most recently, as a critic trying to attract new audiences while encouraging greater virtuosity in the arts. I have tried in
every position to create and cultivate an infrastructure that leveraged technology to increase the capacity of the institution.
(Currently, I am working with Oversight Committee member, Terence McFarland, who I have known and collaborated with
for a decade, on leveraging KCRW’s public radio audience and finding ways to include arts listings on their iPhone app.)
This position with Project Audience represents an opportunity for me to fulfill, on a national level, longstanding goals of
strengthening the artistic community, providing a context for audience engagement, and creating a technological
infrastructure to buttress the arts. I believe that my experience coupled with my passion and commitment uniquely qualify
me for the position.
I have followed Project Audience since 2009 when I signed up to observe the initial phase. I share Project Audience’s
passion and belief that audience development must be more than top-down, vertical marketing. I have deep respect for
the work that the community has already done articulating the current Solution Document. I believe that Project Audience
represents the keystone in a national (and potentially international) technological arts infrastructure that could profoundly
transform the field and provide a platform to engage the entire artistic community and audience in creating a culturally
rich, diverse, engaged society.
Should you find my candidacy for this posting of interest, I trust that there will be time to discuss the position in detail and
for you to question me further regarding my qualifications. However, in advance of an interview, I would like to briefly
share my understanding of some of the key demands of the position and the relevant work history that I believe qualifies
me for the position:
Project Management, Implementation, Fiscal Stewardship
Project Audience’s success depends on having someone to not only help manage the creation of the solution but also
implement it. During my time at Center Theatre Group (CTG), I had the privilege of seeing the Kirk Douglas Theatre
from its conception, literally as a sketch on the back of an envelope, through funding, design, construction,
commissioning and finally, production of the opening season of six world premieres. The project was completed on
time and on budget. Experience from this project that is of particular relevance for Project Audience includes:
• Oversaw the selection of the Architect and key consultants and then participated daily with the entire project
team through the design and construction process;
• Oversaw all deliverables and ensured project adhered to budget, schedule, and specifications (both internally
and externally);
• Participated with outside counsel throughout the negotiation and implementation of the DDA (Disposition and
Development Agreement) and Lease agreements with our key partner, Culver City Redevelopment Agency;
• Managed the flow of information both from CTG stakeholders to outside consultants and vice versa;
• Managed budget for external consultants and contractors and the internal procurement budget of $400,000
for the commissioning of the theater. Both completed on budget to specifications.

I am pleased to submit this application for the Director of the Undergraduate Acting

For the past 14 years I have been dedication to the training, creation and support of
new work, new spaces, new artists and new audiences for the American theatre. That

conservatory training of high school seniors in Los Angeles county; my role as Associate
Producer of New Play Development for Center Theatre Group where I supported the
development of over 100 new works for the theatre; my role as an independent creative
producer and arts administrator helping to foster the work of young playwrights,
directors and institutions; to my role trying to provide context and criticism while
generating a broader audience for the theatre as KCRW’s theatre critic.
That work and connection to the field and specifically Los Angeles has inspired my

rigor that must be the backbone of any professional training program.
I have forged a successful independent career but candidly I am happiest, and I believe

together to forge a trained actor.
This understanding combined with a dramaturg’s understanding of structure, a director’s
gift for guiding work towards excellence, a producer’s ability to create the circumstance,
sustenance, and institutional framework to keep the work alive; a critic’s ability to
provide context and feedback; and an educator’s ability to inspire.

RE: General Manager Position
To Whom It May Concern,
I am pleased to submit an application for the General Manager position at Theater Aspen.
Rewinding several decades to the late 80’s, it was a beautiful summer in Aspen (one of my last after a
childhood growing up there). Artistically it was something of a banner year, I had the good fortune of roles at
both Theater Aspen, in a hoot of a play titled “Drunken Grownups” by Mark Routhier, and a role in “The
Cherry Orchard” at the Snowmass/Aspen Repertory Theater. Between that and a high school job spinning
pizzas at NY Pizza on the mall, it was an idyllic summer.
Fast forward and in the intervening decades, I have dedicated myself to the creation and support of new
artists, new work, new spaces, and new audiences for the American theatre. I have pursued this vision in a
variety of roles: as Associate Producer of New Play Development for Center Theatre Group, I supported the
development of over 100 new works for the theatre and oversaw the restoration of the landmark building that
became the Kirk Douglas Theatre; as Producer and General Manager for the Shakespeare Center of Los
Angeles I was responsible for all business and production activities for the $1.5 million theater and created a
new outdoor venue for the company; as an independent creative producer, director, and arts administrator, I
have fostered the work of new playwrights, directors and institutions; as theatre critic for local NPR affiliate,
KCRW, I have tried to provide context and criticism while generating a broader audience for the theatre in Los
Angeles. I have committed myself to changing the landscape of theatre in Los Angeles while connecting with
the field nationally and internationally.
The idea of returning to my childhood home, Aspen, with the skills and passion for theater that I’ve honed
over the past decades is something of a fantastical dream - akin to the fairy magic of Midsummer.
Should you find my qualifications compelling, I would welcome a conversation about making that dream a
reality. If you need any further information or have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
Anthony Byrnes

RE: Director of Performing Arts Position
Dear Mr. Castro,
Los Angeles' cultural ecosystem is at an inflection point.
You can feel it in our theaters; see it in our audiences.
On our stages, there is more virtuosic work than we've seen in the last 15 years: more glorious moments
when we are reminded of the power and immediacy of the performing arts to cut through the mediation of
technology that rules our modern lives to reconnect us with the essential questions of humanity.
Yet, our non-profits are still trying to dig out from recessionary cutbacks. Our arts leaders struggle for the
capacity to sustain their own organizations. They lack the means to build a larger city-wide collaboration of
audience and culture. Great art is playing to small, often geographically specific houses (not surprising in a
city as big as Los Angeles).
And there is the disparity between what our city looks like and what our performing arts look like: our work on
stage isn't representing or serving the diversity of our city.
How do we create the visibility, capacity, and infrastructure that nurtures virtuosity while ensuring
diversity and access?
Clearly, the primary answer to this challenge must come from the individual arts organizations that make up
our ecosystem: how they meet the world and the profundity with which they believe art can be a vital part of
our society, our city.
But many of these challenges are bigger than a single organization . . .
The Performing Arts Director position, alongside the other successful initiatives and leadership of the
Department of Cultural Affairs and in concert with Mayor Garcetti's broader goals and initiatives, have the
potential to directly and meaningfully impact this challenge and bring us closer to having art reach every
single Angeleno.

**Pattern**: "Additionally, the steering committee—comprised of staff, faculty, a
student, and an alumnus—took on this demanding work alongside their full schedules and without
additional compensation."

**Context**: ANTHONY BYRNES - Cover Letter page 2 of 6
These changes reduced our highest advising caseload from 665 to 389 students—a 41% improvement
—and allowed our advising lead to refocus his time on critical leadership tasks instead of direct
advising. While the solution is not yet permanent, it represents a significant step toward a more
equitable, proactive, student-centered advising culture.
To sustain this progress, at the beginning of the 24-25 academic year, I invited four of our advising
leads to join me on a University Data Fellows project to identify and catalogue equity gaps among
COTA students. This initiative will help better position COTA for future funding opportunities as part of
the Chancellor’s new program to replace GI2015 and will further elevate the visibility and expertise of
our advisors across the university.
The progress I have been able make in this area reflects my ability to effectively collaborate within
COTA and across the university, creatively address challenges within existing structures and funding
mechanisms, and remain committed to equity and excellence for our students, staff, and faculty.
Strategic Planning Process
One of Dean Smith’s key priorities when he began in his role was the development of a long-overdue
strategic plan for the College. To lead this effort, he engaged an outside consulting firm and appointed
Associate Dean Chiara Ferrari and me as co-chairs of the process. Chiara and I began our work with a
22-person steering committee and a foundational plan developed by the consultant.
We quickly realized that while the consultant’s plan could guide the creation of a strategic plan, it would
not foster the conditions necessary for its success within the college. COTA’s culture and ethos required
a more open and inclusive process. Additionally, the steering committee—comprised of staff, faculty, a
student, and an alumnus—took on this demanding work alongside their full schedules and without
additional compensation.
Chiara and I quickly developed a parallel process to the consultant’s plan, designed to foster broader
engagement and reimagine the steering committee’s role. We also recognized the importance of
incorporating input from students, faculty, staff, alumni, and donors. To achieve this, we implemented
college-wide surveys, organized a day of focus group meetings, and facilitated several group retreats.
For the committee, we fostered a meeting culture that respected members’ time by using meetings to
engage their voices and opinions rather than simply provide updates. This required us to support the
committee by sharing relevant information in advance and carefully scheduling meetings around their
availability.
Chiara and I transformed the committee from a reserved and skeptical group at the first meeting into a
collaborative team that, by the final meeting, worked efficiently and creatively resulting in a first draft of
a strategic plan that reflected multiple feedback points from across the college.
I share this experience to highlight my strong collaborative partnership with Chiara and our mutual
respect for students, faculty, and staff, as well as their contributions to the college’s shared goals. I
believe the strategic plan reflects this ethos and commitment.
Third Attempt Meetings
I’ll be honest: third-attempt meetings are my favorite part of the position. These occur when a student
who has failed a class twice has to meet with the Associate Dean to seek permission for a third attempt.
These are not easy meetings for students—they’ve tried twice and haven’t made it across the line, and
it can feel like being sent to the principal’s office. They’re challenging for me, too, as the stories are

TFT will transform the lives of those who teach, learn, and create here, ultimately influencing the
broader field and society where the work we produce resides and resonates.
At the heart of this support, there must be an intentional and active cultivation of a culture of belonging
and respect for everyone who engages with TFT. In our current historical moment, marked by
challenges across all dimensions of society, the spaces where we work, create, study, and learn must
be free from fear and toxicity—places where everyone feels safe, supported, and valued. While such
conditions may have been assumed on university campuses in the past, today they require deliberate
and ongoing effort to articulate and uphold.
Building on this foundation, my second priority would be to extend this culture of respect and support
from the school to the broader university community.
Strengthening ties between TFT and the University
In a public university, the success of a school depends on a healthy, collaborative relationship and
mutual respect between the school and the university's upper administration. I bring a strong track
record of working within another public university and am adept at bridging the gap between the unique
needs of the arts and the broader priorities and processes of the university. Often, the complexities and
nuances of creative disciplines can be difficult for traditional academic or bureaucratic systems to fully
grasp, particularly when it comes to understanding their value and impact.
Throughout my career, I have navigated both the creative and administrative realms—one foot in the
rehearsal room or classroom, the other in the board room or institutional leadership. This dual
perspective—spanning the creative process and institutional management—has sharpened my skills as
a translator, communicator, and advocate who can, for example, clarify and contextualize fiscal realities
alongside artistic or scholarly aspirations while ensuring that the integrity of both are preserved.
Coupled with a transparent, collaborative, and inclusive leadership style and fiscal responsibility, I have
consistently earned the trust and respect of administration, staff, faculty, and students. These qualities
have enabled me to serve as an effective and creative advocate for the institutions I have been
privileged to serve and to increase their capacity through strategic management and investment.
Transformational Philanthropy
My third priority—and likely the most critical to unlocking TFT’s full potential—is actively securing and
creating diversified, sustainable revenue streams. This work would begin by ensuring that the school
has the necessary infrastructure in place to pursue a transformative naming gift. Achieving this requires
a process of strategic engagement (that I will outline further below) to craft a clear, unique, and
consistent narrative, or “story”, for TFT, supported by meaningful impact metrics. The narrative must
articulate how a gift of this magnitude would transform the school: advancing faculty scholarship and
practice, shaping the lives and careers of students, and ultimately driving innovation in our fields and
meaningful change in society. While this narrative and vision would be shaped through close
collaboration with TFT’s stakeholders, I will, in my closing, share my own version and the impact that
inspires me to apply to be your next dean.
If the lessons of another public university system, namely CSU, offer any lessons, this work must be
accompanied by a creative and entrepreneurial approach to developing additional revenue streams for
the school. Articulating specific solutions without a deep understanding of TFT’s current practices would
be premature. However, I believe any solution must avoid compromising the school’s core mission or
reputation and must consider its full impacts. Given the seismic shifts in state funding and the evolving
economics of the arts in universities nationwide, traditional funding models are no longer sufficient.

**Pattern**: "UCLA’s public arts units all have new leaders building on the sturdy shoulders of their
predecessors: Zoe Ryan begins her tenure at the Hammer Museum in January, CAP UCLA’s Edgar
Miramontes is currently enjoying his inaugural season as artistic and executive director, and Silvia
Forni, the relative elder, began her tenure as director of the Fowler Museum just two years ago."

**Context**: ANTHONY BYRNES - Cover Letter page 4 of 5
As I mentioned earlier, strategic engagement is at the core of my work. At its best, strategic
engagement combines communication, advancement, and community outreach in alignment with an
institution’s values, culture, and mission. This integrated approach begins with understanding and
sharing the stories that highlight an organization’s significance and impact. From there, it identifies
opportunities to leverage the arts’ natural ability to serve as a gateway to community and forge
successful and meaningful partnerships. While always protecting the integrity of the art, every
engagement should tell the story of excellence and impact.
As a fundraiser, I’ve been fortunate to have raised in excess of $27 million across the institutions I’ve
supported, either through direct asks or in collaboration with development colleagues. Of that total, $18
million was raised as part of the successful capital campaign for the Kirk Douglas Theater at Center
Theater Group. This project holds particular meaning for me because it initially faced significant
skepticism, with a feasibility study suggesting insufficient donor support. What made that project a
reality was as much a shift in internal culture as it was the generosity of any donor or public/private
partnership. We were able to remove the obstacles to belief in the project and created a narrative and
plan for the project that was realistic and easily understandable. Importantly, we delivered a fiscally
responsible on-time, on-budget project with the support of donors who had a clear understanding of the
challenges and impacts. This experience reinforced for me that successful campaigns require
unwavering integrity, alignment between the project and donor goals, and transparent communication
about challenges and impacts. These lessons have served me well and have guided every campaign
I’ve led, ensuring transformative gifts that increased each organization’s capacity to fulfill its mission.
Which brings me to the importance of culture of place and the perhaps often-overlooked idea that we
should love where we work. All of us—staff, faculty, and administrators—entered academia because we
are passionate about what we do. The past few years have been difficult for everyone. I believe it’s
essential that we find joy in our work and the people with whom we have the privilege to collaborate.
While no dean can remove all obstacles, solve every challenge, or seize every opportunity, I believe
they can set a tone for the culture of the institution and an appreciation for everyone who works,
creates, and studies there. Alongside the priorities discussed above, I bring to my work a sense of
playful joy and gratitude for the opportunity to do what I love.
Why UCLA? Why TFT? Why now?
UCLA, TFT, and the arts at UCLA more broadly stand at the threshold of an exciting moment. Your new
chancellor is profoundly inspiring—his work, engagement, and core beliefs speak not only to the
challenges of our time but also to the deeper, systemic issues at the heart of our society. His
appreciation for arts and their role in driving change offers a beacon and a call to action. Across UCLA,
the arts are entering a moment of renewal and opportunity. Alongside TFT, both the School of the Arts
and Architecture and the Herb Alpert School of Music are poised to welcome new deans in the coming
years. UCLA’s public arts units all have new leaders building on the sturdy shoulders of their
predecessors: Zoe Ryan begins her tenure at the Hammer Museum in January, CAP UCLA’s Edgar
Miramontes is currently enjoying his inaugural season as artistic and executive director, and Silvia
Forni, the relative elder, began her tenure as director of the Fowler Museum just two years ago. Even
beyond UCLA, but with deep, historic ties to TFT, Tarrell Alvin McCraney is charting a fierce new course
at the Geffen Playhouse.
We know in the arts that our success is never a zero-sum game: a rising tide truly lifts all boats. The
arts at UCLA are entering a vital new chapter. The potential for transformation and to fulfill the promise
and impact of TFT and the arts through scholarship, research, and practice is profound not only on
campus but across our communities and industries.

stairs in the building in addition to an elevator."

February 27, 2023
ADDENDA: Diversity Statement
(While not a required document for application, I am respectfully submitting this diversity statement as
an important reflection on my values and how I have approached my work throughout my professional
career.)
I have had the good fortune to be engaged in diverse, vibrant artistic dialogues since the beginning of
my professional career as Associate Producer for New Play Development at Center Theatre Group
(CTG). When I joined CTG in 1997, the Taper Playwright Labs were already well established: LTI -
Latino Theatre Initiative, Blacksmyths, ATW - Asian Theatre Workshop, Writers Workshop, and Other
Voices - a lab for playwrights and artists with disabilities. Our collective raison d’être was to champion
and produce new diverse stories that represented the communities of Southern California.
While my work and personal values were deeply impacted by all the remarkable artists with whom I
was privileged to work, I want to share the impact the playwright John Belluso had on me, and
ultimately on the architecture of the Kirk Douglas Theatre and Mark Taper Forum.
John used a wheelchair. He had a degenerative bone disease that ultimately took his life. He was a
fierce advocate and champion for the disabled community. Access, equity, anger, and appreciation
coursed through his political plays.
John also didn’t have a car. In L.A., that meant since all of us in New Play Development travelled in a
pack, that we all became intimately familiar with the obstacles that John faced as we travelled to
second story theaters and rehearsal rooms without ramps. This came to a head when John received
the Sherwood Award at the Taper. The award ceremony traditionally took place on the opening night of
a production and involved having the honoree join Gordon Davidson on stage. The Taper had
wheelchair accessible seats in the theater, but it had no ramp backstage and all the dressing rooms
were up a flight of stairs. To accept his award, John was supposed to make it from the audience to the
stage. There was no accessible route. The architecture of the building never contemplated that
someone using a wheelchair might be an artist on stage.
It was a painful realization.
At the same time, I was working with the architects and theater consultants on the new Kirk Douglas
Theatre. The theatre consultants, who had been engaged on the project before the architects, had
designed a theater that required everyone in the audience to go up a flight of stairs to enter the theater.
It was a lovely design, but save for an elevator that would allow someone to sit in the very back row,
totally inaccessible.
John’s presence on our artistic staff and as a friend made that wholly unacceptable. There was no way I
could share a set of plans that excluded John who had extolled the merits of universal design.
I worked with our production department to come up with a different design strategy that had the entire
theater from the backstage dressing rooms to the front entrance all on a single level: meaning both
artists and audience—whether they used a wheelchair or not—could gain access to the theater without
encountering a single stair.
In June of 2002, I proudly shared the plans with John, but sheepishly apologized that there were indeed
stairs in the building in addition to an elevator. John wasn’t finished teaching me when he said, “It’s not
about removing all challenges. It’s about ensuring that everyone has a choice which challenges they
want to tackle.”

our current students, our prospective students, our alumni, our fields, our supporters, and all of our
neighbors. This process isn’t simply about knowing our story (any more than reading a piece of music is
the same as performing it). It’s about engaging and understanding our audiences and sharing with them
the wonder and value we experience in each of our disciplines and in our classrooms.
To ground these ideas, indulge me while I tell a story.
Bona fides: Center Theatre Group, Associate Producer of New Play Development
When we were first beginning fundraising before the construction of the Kirk Douglas Theatre project,
we made a trip to the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. They had just completed a similar project and as
we walked through they regaled us with the story of an unexpected million dollar gift. During the soft
launch of their capital campaign, two brothers read the posters in the lobby that articulated the goals
and impact of the project. Several days later, the director of development got a call from two first time
donors. Their gift was both a shock to the theater and significant enough to merit a naming opportunity.
Several years after this Goodman trip, I was leading a community hard hat tour at the soon-to-be-
completed Kirk Douglas Theatre. The walkthrough wasn't a development event, but a way to engage
the community. Several days after the tour, our director of development received a call from a first time
donor. I wish I could say that $100k gift merited a naming opportunity, but it did cement for me the
importance of treating every engagement, both internal and external, as a part of a larger, holistic
strategic engagement process. We are always fundraising, we are always telling our stories, and we
are always serving our communities.
The importance of the whole.
Throughout my professional career, an appreciation and understanding of the broader ecosystem or
'whole' has guided my approach. I am able to recognize connections across an organization or
community, think across a system—be it a department or an entire institution—and analyze and
understand the connections, the dependencies of underlying structures, and how their strategic
disposition yields a particular result. Beyond recognizing and understanding these connections, I am
able to make them visible and comprehensible to others while collaboratively designing strategies to
either change the structure through new policies or practices or work within them to change the
outcomes.
These strategic skills equip me to not simply manage the resources of the institutions I help lead, but to
expand their capacity in alignment with a broader institutional mission and goals. For me, leadership is
not simply about reactively addressing problems—it is about creating the infrastructure to address the
causes.
Bona fides: CSULB, Chair, Curriculum Committee Chair, Data Fellow
When I first started tackling curriculum in the Theatre Arts Department, I was struck by two things: one,
the process of scheduling and inputing a semester’s schedule for our Admin. Analyst, Jen White, took
more time than it should; two, to try and understand all the dimensions of the curricular ‘budgets’ (units,
WTU’s, classrooms) required jumping between disparate university reports that all contained only part
of the full picture. Clearly, these two things were connected.
Building on my passion for data and my experience as a University Data Fellow I set out to solve these
problems.
My creation of a robust curricular database that can be quickly and efficiently updated has been key to
this work. Seeing and understanding the data has helped the department understand itself both
historically and currently. It also serves as a powerful strategic, forward planning tool. Building on my

Your current faculty are essential partners in the shifts in culture and practice that our time requires.
Only through championing their growth, success, and development will the culture evolve.
At CSULB, in addition to my ongoing support of existing faculty through their tenure, evaluation, and
creative practices, I am grateful for the faculty of color I have brought to the department as adjuncts
who are providing essential representation, mentorship, and support for our students. These adjunct
faculty have helped me to further recognize both the structural and cultural shifts necessary to support
their work and presence on our campus.
My advocacy and support of students at CSULB is steadfast and my commitment to their success
foundational. The barriers and obstacles that come with a career in the arts demand that we support
their learning with degrees and skills that allow them to craft meaningful, sustainable careers. I draw on
my work with the graduate program I lead, an MBA/MFA in Theatre Management, recognizing that the
skills that lead graduates to their first job out of school, can also—through careful preparation and a
diverse curriculum—help them 'leap frog' into their second and third positions. By understanding the
needs and challenges of the field now (not as we experienced it when we were our students’ age) and
addressing those needs and skills directly in a program’s curricular structure, our students can graduate
with degrees of value leading to careers that support them. Partnering with our professional fields
through understanding, access, programs, and direct support strengthens our work in the classroom or
rehearsal hall or studio and helps clarify it.
At CSULB, I am particularly proud of my work diversifying our curriculum and championing equitable
resource allocation at both the department and college level across multiple dimensions for our entire
student population. My creation of a robust curricular database that can be quickly and efficiently
updated has been key to this work. Seeing and understanding the data has helped the department
understand itself both historically and currently. It also serves as a powerful strategic, forward planning
tool. Building on my work as a University Data Fellow, I was able to draw from four distinct university
data sources. This allows curricular discussions and department planning to consider multiple
dimensions quickly and in an integrated manner rather than in a segregated manner through a series of
isolated conversations where student unit loads and faculty compensation (WTU’s) are discussed
separately. With the database as an essential strategic instrument, we are able to consider multiple
budgets at once: the student unit ‘budget’, the instructional budget, the personnel budget, and the
space budget. This accessible database has served as the foundation for curricular and resource
allocation discussions amongst faculty replacing vague or selective institutional memory with a shared
and accepted set of data transparent to all parties. The success of this tool at the department level has
led to a broader college-wide implementation discussion. As I will revisit below, this project is indicative
both of my collaborative, data-driven, transparent leadership style and my approach to working within
the existing structures of a large bureaucratic organization.

### Unknown - my_documents/converted/AJB cover letter- PROJECT AUDIENCE.pdf

**Pattern**: "In addition to the skills outlined in your job description, I believe I bring the following skills to Project Audience:
Vision
I share Project Audience’s view that this solution is just one part of a constellation of services that can profoundly
transform the way the arts are engaged and practiced."

**Context**: Technology Management and Oversight
Beyond the technological integration, coordination, consultant oversight and management required for the Kirk
Douglas Theater, I have also overseen the creation of the first university-wide arts website at USC. While far more
modest in its technical goals, the website did provide a microcosm of the political and technical issues involved with
getting different organizations (in this case, five distinct art schools within the University) to collaborate. The site
resulted in /arts becoming a top-level university domain.
• I have also personally designed relational databases and web solutions for small work groups (from five to 25
users). Again, while vastly more modest than the goals of Project Audience, this experience gives me the
structural basis to speak the language and manage not only the theoretical issues but also their practical
implementation.
• The flip side of managing technology is managing the anxiety and fear of technology by end users and
organizations. Whether this is a question of education (providing the metaphors and explanations for the
problem), inspiration (revealing the promise of the technology), or adoption (translating the benefits of the
technology into the lingua franca of the organization), I have the ability to manage both the technology and
the fear it engenders.
Collaboration, Communication, Inspiration
Project Audience has, in fact, many audiences and many stakeholders. Taking care of each of those audiences and
engaging every stakeholder is central to the project’s success. I regard this responsibility as fundamental to the
challenge of successfully directing the effort. Based on my previous experience, I believe I have an appreciation for
each audience and a facility for understanding their needs. For example:
• Non-Profit Board
Through my work at CTG, I understand the culture, responsibility, collaboration, and
communication necessary to realize projects in the non-profit world. As Project Audience defines its
governing structure, particular care will need to be paid to this relationship as both the project and the board
structure come into being.
• Funders and Key Stakeholders
Candidly, in my previous roles, I have witnessed both effective and terrible communication with funders and
key stakeholders. What I have learned is that the communication, involvement and inspiration of funders and
stakeholders must be a core principle of the organization. I look forward to continuing the transparent and
comprehensive culture that Project Audience has already created and to passionately and articulately
inspiring others to join the effort.
• Institutional Development
Project Audience is creating not only a technology solution but also a new institution (or possibly a new
branch of an institution). This requires someone who can not only manage a design process but
simultaneously create a culture within which each new partner or staff member works. I was able to not only
build a building with the Kirk Douglas Theater but create an entire staff and a culture of production.
In addition to the skills outlined in your job description, I believe I bring the following skills to Project Audience:
Vision
I share Project Audience’s view that this solution is just one part of a constellation of services that can profoundly
transform the way the arts are engaged and practiced. There will clearly be many functions, many goals that will be

To the members of the Project Audience Oversight Committee,
I am pleased to submit this application for the role of Program Director for Project Audience. I have been engaged in the
challenges of audience development for many years in many different roles: as a passionate audience member, an artist,
a producer and arts administrator within a major regional theater striving to create a body of work and cultivate the
participation of new artists and audiences, as an university liaison to the arts community trying to foster cultural literacy
and nurture the arts patrons of tomorrow, as a teacher both to the professional field and to aspiring high school students,
and most recently, as a critic trying to attract new audiences while encouraging greater virtuosity in the arts. I have tried in
every position to create and cultivate an infrastructure that leveraged technology to increase the capacity of the institution.
(Currently, I am working with Oversight Committee member, Terence McFarland, who I have known and collaborated with
for a decade, on leveraging KCRW’s public radio audience and finding ways to include arts listings on their iPhone app.)
This position with Project Audience represents an opportunity for me to fulfill, on a national level, longstanding goals of
strengthening the artistic community, providing a context for audience engagement, and creating a technological
infrastructure to buttress the arts. I believe that my experience coupled with my passion and commitment uniquely qualify
me for the position.
I have followed Project Audience since 2009 when I signed up to observe the initial phase. I share Project Audience’s
passion and belief that audience development must be more than top-down, vertical marketing. I have deep respect for
the work that the community has already done articulating the current Solution Document. I believe that Project Audience
represents the keystone in a national (and potentially international) technological arts infrastructure that could profoundly
transform the field and provide a platform to engage the entire artistic community and audience in creating a culturally
rich, diverse, engaged society.
Should you find my candidacy for this posting of interest, I trust that there will be time to discuss the position in detail and
for you to question me further regarding my qualifications. However, in advance of an interview, I would like to briefly
share my understanding of some of the key demands of the position and the relevant work history that I believe qualifies
me for the position:
Project Management, Implementation, Fiscal Stewardship
Project Audience’s success depends on having someone to not only help manage the creation of the solution but also
implement it. During my time at Center Theatre Group (CTG), I had the privilege of seeing the Kirk Douglas Theatre
from its conception, literally as a sketch on the back of an envelope, through funding, design, construction,
commissioning and finally, production of the opening season of six world premieres. The project was completed on
time and on budget. Experience from this project that is of particular relevance for Project Audience includes:
• Oversaw the selection of the Architect and key consultants and then participated daily with the entire project
team through the design and construction process;
• Oversaw all deliverables and ensured project adhered to budget, schedule, and specifications (both internally
and externally);
• Participated with outside counsel throughout the negotiation and implementation of the DDA (Disposition and
Development Agreement) and Lease agreements with our key partner, Culver City Redevelopment Agency;
• Managed the flow of information both from CTG stakeholders to outside consultants and vice versa;
• Managed budget for external consultants and contractors and the internal procurement budget of $400,000
for the commissioning of the theater. Both completed on budget to specifications.
