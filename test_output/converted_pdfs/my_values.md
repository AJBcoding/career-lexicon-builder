> "I believe that it is from this highly attuned and informed position that one
can cultivate productive partnerships, develop effective strategies, and connect and communicate
successfully with a community."

**Context**: In order to build constructive relationships and successful strategies to
carry an institution forward, one must first listen: listen closely to one’s partners, one’s constituents,
one’s audience, one’s context. I believe that it is from this highly attuned and informed position that one
can cultivate productive partnerships, develop effective strategies, and connect and communicate
successfully with a community. I find my value is often in describing an organization to itself in the terms defined by that organization.

Operationally, that means a careful listening to each department, school, and unit to recognize not
simply what is working and what is not, but also to identify and amplify the common themes and
strategies across the college that form our collective narratives.

> "I believe that it is only from this
deeply attuned and informed perspective that one can cultivate productive partnerships, develop
effective strategies, and successfully connect with and communicate within a community."

**Context**: Listening before acting is a cornerstone of my leadership approach, particularly when engaging those
who may have been excluded from such conversations in the past. I believe that it is only from this
deeply attuned and informed perspective that one can cultivate productive partnerships, develop
effective strategies, and successfully connect with and communicate within a community. While I have
not yet had the opportunity to hear directly from the faculty, students, staff, and donors who comprise
the TFT community, I recognize theirs are the essential voices.

> "I believe it’s
essential that we find joy in our work and the people with whom we have the privilege to collaborate."

**Context**: The past few years have been difficult for everyone. I believe it’s
essential that we find joy in our work and the people with whom we have the privilege to collaborate. While no dean can remove all obstacles, solve every challenge, or seize every opportunity, I believe
they can set a tone for the culture of the institution and an appreciation for everyone who works,
creates, and studies there.

> "I believe it's
essential that we find joy in our work and the people with whom we have the privilege to collaborate."

**Context**: All of us—staff,
artists, administrators—entered this field because we are passionate about what we do. I believe it's
essential that we find joy in our work and the people with whom we have the privilege to collaborate. While no general manager can remove all obstacles or solve every challenge, they can set a tone for
the culture of the space and an appreciation for everyone who works, creates, and performs there
because the culture we create behind the scenes directly shapes what audiences and artists
experience.

> "I believe, can help steward in the kinds of cultural shifts we have the
opportunity and need to make to successfully face our greatest challenges and realize our untapped
potential as an institution."

**Context**: To respond effectively to these grand challenges, we must have a full understanding of all of our
infrastructure: not only physical, but the human infrastructure and the cultural infrastructure that we rely
on every day. The approach I am outlining, I believe, can help steward in the kinds of cultural shifts we have the
opportunity and need to make to successfully face our greatest challenges and realize our untapped
potential as an institution. This shift begins with: understanding who we are here to serve and the
moment and context we are in; listening deeply to all stakeholders (especially those who have been
previously excluded); listening to the college and university for the underlying mission and values that
authentically reflect and unite stakeholders and institution; connecting and transforming that listening
into a compelling story that both confirms that people have been heard and helps their story reach their
audience; collaboratively and transparently managing with a holistic, integrated vision that strategically
leverages our resources (fiscal, human, and physical) in a sustainable way that extends our stories and
our impact.

**Context**: This
‘laboratory’ provides the perfect forum for bringing together the broader curriculum and helping a young artist recognize the matrix of
connections that form their own process. I believe deeply that actors need to be aware of not only the connections in their own process but also the broader field they are
entering. Though my outside work as a producer and critic, I strive to connect my students with theatrical landscape at the same time
that I am teaching them the historical and theoretical context in which these two trainings exist.

**Context**: Which begs the perennial Los Angeles question: what is theatre’s relationship to
Hollywood? Unapologetically, I believe that a world-class training in the theatre not only
has integrity on its own but is the best foundation for a meaningful career as an actor in
America. That said, I would encourage the same holistic questioning of the faculty and
curriculum to ensure that we are mentoring our students not only artistically but
professionally.

**Context**: Having provided steady
and compassionate leadership through this extraordinary crisis myself, I am confident that my unique
combination of professional experiences, academic work, and service as an advocate/liaison/voice for
the general public provides me with the breadth and depth of skills and capacities from which to
successfully lead the College of the Arts at Cal State Fullerton into the future. I believe the dean of an arts college should be a listener, translator, storyteller, manager, partner, and

triumphed over the challenges and reminded us of the future we are building with every class, every
student, in every interaction. This trial by fire has focused me on what I believe I have to offer the university and the college as its
next dean. While the past never offers a blueprint for the future, it can sketch the outlines of the critical
path forward and bring into stark relief the essential issues that must be addressed and opportunities
waiting to be seized.

Put simply: I believe that I have the ability to fundraise, manage and implement as a producer, the ability to dream like

rigor that must be the backbone of any professional training program. I have forged a successful independent career but candidly I am happiest, and I believe
most valuable to the broader field, when I am fostering excellence within an institution. Which draws me to this position within the School of Theatre and the challenge of

**Context**: A connection to acting in other media must be an institutional
commitment that extends beyond specialized classes and becomes a part of the
institutional dna - but this commitment cannot in any way jeopardize or water down the
integrity of the existing training. This conundrum, I believe, must be shared by not only
USC’s graduates but by the curriculum itself. I believe it is the culmination of these elements: personal excellence and inspiration,
institutional excellence fostered by a common language and a rigorous faculty-wide
collaboration informed by the difficult and salient questions, a deep connection to the
field and specifically Los Angeles both artistically and professionally that will lead to the
visibility and support that USC richly deserves.

**Context**: I also appreciate that institutional excellence and change take time (see my 5 year plan
attached). I believe my previous experience with USC and collaborative experience
with the faculty I’ve had the pleasure of working with will lessen the learning curve while
still preserving a fresh set of eyes and ears on the program. As my 14 years of training with SITI Company emphasizes and my perseverance
following the Kirk Douglas Theatre from the conceptual phase in 1997 through
producing the inaugural season in 2004 demonstrates, I am deeply commited and will
continue to evolve, adapt, and revise in collaboration with the many voices of an
institution without losing focus or dedication.

I share Project Audience’s view that this solution is just one part of a constellation of services that can profoundly

obstacles for an audience but instead, to ensure that the challenges that they encountered were the ones that they
chose. I believe firmly that this is an approach that can and should be successfully applied not only to the

that fosters [better word] excellence both individually and collectively."

**Context**: Do I know where my voice fits into the larger curriculum? The candor and commitment with which an institution can be inspired to answer and
tackle these questions is, I believe, the first step towards creation a common language
that fosters [better word] excellence both individually and collectively. My background equips me to not only pose these questions but also guide the resulting
conversation in a collaborative, inclusive way [awk.] I believe that this conversation is a
critical step because the success of a training program is contingent on a common
shared language - not to create a homogenous single voice or method of instruction but
to provide a rosetta stone to integrate and help navigate between a varied, dynamic
curriculum.

energy possible with so many talented collaborators that makes the challenge of USC
so exciting. I believe that a culture of excellence is the result of this common language coupled with

my inquiry would make possible. I believe my experience would also help me to buttress the work of the Artistic Director

essential weavers of the fabric of a just, equitable society. I am inspired to apply for the position of dean because I believe the UCLA School of Theater, Film and
Television is uniquely positioned to lead during this historic moment. As part of the nation’s premier
public university, located in the creative capital of the world, the school holds a diverse student body,
faculty, and staff deeply committed to both creation and scholarship in pursuit of a more inclusive
future.

**Context**: And through that alliance with, and of, the community – encourage the kind of broad collaboration and buy-in

offering meaningful and measurable implementation that both meets the community where it is and helps it to

essential and indispensable to the community and the city. Why me?

This position with Project Audience represents an opportunity for me to fulfill, on a national level, longstanding goals of

infrastructure to buttress the arts. I believe that my experience coupled with my passion and commitment uniquely qualify
me for the position. I have followed Project Audience since 2009 when I signed up to observe the initial phase.

me for the position:
Project Management, Implementation, Fiscal Stewardship
Project Audience’s success depends on having someone to not only help manage the creation of the solution but also
implement it."

**Context**: Should you find my candidacy for this posting of interest, I trust that there will be time to discuss the position in detail and

commissioning and finally, production of the opening season of six world premieres.

## I Believe My Experience Would

#### Unknown - my_documents/converted/USC - Cover Letter.pdf

> "I believe my experience would also help me to buttress the work of the Artistic Director
selecting, staffing, and producing the season."

**Context**: I believe that a culture of excellence is the result of this common language coupled with
an ongoing dialogue that I feel confident the breadth of my background and the depth of
my inquiry would make possible. I believe my experience would also help me to buttress the work of the Artistic Director

local and visiting professional talent pool (not only from my years of new play
development but also my current role at KCRW) is a ready resource that I’ve already
brought to bear and collaborated with key faculty during the production of the Under
Construction/New Works 3 Festival.

## I Believe Any Solution Must

> "I believe any solution must avoid compromising the school’s core mission or
reputation and must consider its full impacts."

**Context**: Articulating specific solutions without a deep understanding of TFT’s current practices would
be premature. However, I believe any solution must avoid compromising the school’s core mission or
reputation and must consider its full impacts. Given the seismic shifts in state funding and the evolving
economics of the arts in universities nationwide, traditional funding models are no longer sufficient.
